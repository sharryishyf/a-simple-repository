Last week Why do I care about this? But why do I need to care about this?  A is a kind of question about what's the reason for it? AnyoneIn your previous classes, you've never thought about itYou're going to the laboratory and ee 103 or 109 You built a circuit, you connected a signal generator to the circuit with a piece of wire, and you never thought aboutdo I need to care about the piece of choirStrange. Why are we talking about it that? Welllet's considerateIf this is only half a meter long, but say principle, let's say my my transmission line is 1 meter longNow, let's say that my signal generators operating a 1 megahertzWhat is the wavelength of 1 megahertzThis is a questionAnybody be able to tell me that's assuming the wave is traveling at the velocity C 3 times 10 to the power 8 meters per second.

上个星期我为什么要关心这个？但我为什么要关心这？A是一种关于它的原因是什么的问题。有人吗在你以前的课上，你从来没有想过这个问题。你要去实验室和电子邮件。103或109你建立了一个电路，你用一根电线把一个信号发生器连接到电路上，你从来没有想过我需要关心唱诗班的作品吗？奇怪的。我们为什么要讨论这个？好吧让我们考虑周到如果这只有半米长，但说原则，让我们说我的我的传输线有1米长。现在，让我们假设我的信号发生器运行1兆赫1兆赫的波长是多少？这是一个问题。有人能告诉我这是假设吗？波以速度C传播3乘以10的8次方每秒米。

Assuming that what is the wavelength of the way traveling along the transmission line300 apples, oranges meters, exactly 300 metersLambda is equal to V divided by head, or in this case, C divided by something I simply expect you to know, probably studying this at high school in my mind.

假设沿着传输线传播的波长是多少？300个苹果，桔子米，正好300米λ等于V除以水头，或者在这种情况下，等于C除以我只是想让你知道，可能在高中的时候我就在想这个。

AnywayWhat does that really mean if I was to look at the voltage traveling along the transmission lines at any point in time by frozen time I looked at the voltage variationIt would look sinusoidal in this case. And it would be 300 meters longOne period would be 300 meters long with that in mindwhat is the maximum variation of voltage at any particular time on my transmission lossWe have options Who thinks there is no variation at all in voltage along the length of the transmission line? As only meWho thinks it's BThe peak voltage is how much my voltage will vary along the length of the transmission line at any one time. So long time agoseeing 2 times the people didIn other words, bp to Pfor me, it will be negligibleI can't say it's zero. But it's not important who has no ideaI didn't put that as an E option, but if we get out E know, I didwe'll think about it.

无论如何如果我通过冻结时间来观察在任何时间点沿着输电线路传输的电压，这到底意味着什么？我看了电压变化。在这种情况下，它看起来是正弦曲线。和它将有300米长。一个周期将有300米长。考虑到这一点电压的最大变化是多少？在任何特定的时间关于我的传输损失我们有选择谁认为沿着输电线路的长度，电压完全没有变化？正如只有我谁认为是B？峰值电压是指在任何时候，我的电压沿传输线长度变化的程度。很久以前看了两次人们做的。换句话说，BP到P对我来说，这将是微不足道的。我不能说它是零但是这不重要谁不知道？我没有把它作为一个E选项，但是如果我们出去了，我知道，我做了我们会考虑的。

My transmission line is 1 meter longbut my voltage wave is 300 meters longAt any particular time, the voltage differencemaximum amount of voltage difference on the line is going to be negligibleI'm saying zerobut it will be something. So if at this point in timemy way was just coming out of the single generator here. Then 4 meter later, I'm not going to have moved very far along that voltage wave when you go to have moved a very small distanceThere's a voltage wave is 300 meters longnot a meat alone Actually, the voltage difference here is negligible, and that should be reasonableThat should be, okayI don't typically see a voltage difference between the ends of my transmission line. I put a voltage in one end. It immediately comes out of the other end.  That's how you think about it

我的传输线有1米长。但我的电压波有300米长。在任何特定时间，电压差线路上的最大电压差可以忽略不计我说的是零但这将是一件大事。所以如果在这个时间点我的路是从这里的一个发电机出来的。然后4米后，当你移动很小的距离时，我不会沿着电压波移动很远。有一个300米长的电压波不只是一块肉实际上，这里的电压差可以忽略不计，这应该是合理的。那应该是，好吗？我通常看不到电压差在我的传输线两端之间。我在一端加了电压。它立即从另一端出来。你就是这么想的。

Let's see what happens if we go to one gigahertzBut one gigahertz that1×10to the9thmy wavelength becomes.3 metersNow, what is the answer to my question? What is the maximum variation in voltage and all the transmission line The answer this time should be seenIn fact, I will have three whole cycles that might want to quit along the transmission line at any one timea little bit more freedomNot because my voltage wave is 0.3 meters longmy transmission line is 1 meter longIt can fit into their free timeAnd a little bit The total variation in voltage at any point time is 2 times the peak voting Now I have a case where although this is just two conductors connected completely and put it out forI now have a variation in voltage along the length of the conductors This can cause a lot of problems

让我们看看如果我们达到1千兆赫会发生什么但是1千兆赫从1×10到9我的波长变成.3米。现在，我的问题的答案是什么？电压和所有传输线的最大变化是多少这次的答案应该可以看到。事实上，我将有三个完整的周期，可能想要在任何时候沿着传输线退出。多一点自由。不是因为我的电压波有0.3米长。我的传输线有1米长。它可以适应他们的空闲时间。还有一点点。任何时间点的总电压变化是峰值表决的2倍现在我有个案子虽然这只是两个导体完全连接，并把它拿出来我现在有一个电压变化。沿着导体的长度这会导致很多问题。

This is not something you have seen that all laboratory sessions, because you're working in quite low frequency as soon as your wavelength becomes appreciable in terms of the length of the transmission lineyou start seeing voltage variations along individual conductors, current variationalong individual conductors, and we have to account for themWe have to think 12Any questions about why this is kind of the crux. GoodThe real fundamental reason as to why we have to study this subjectory as to why things become more complicated as frequency increasesas we blame for usersthen the wavelength becomes similar or even shorter than the length. So for which we are using themand that there has to be accounted forThat is what we are studying thisHopefullyalthough there's lots of very blankLooks around the lecture hall Hopefully that's a little bit clear Can we apply AC circuit theory You've learned lots of circuit theory already to analyze this situation, how we do so

这不是你在所有的实验室会议上看到的，因为你的工作频率很低。一旦你的波长变得可观就传输线的长度而言你开始看到沿着单个导体的电压变化，电流变化沿着单独的导体，我们必须对它们负责。我们必须认为12关于原因有什么问题吗？这就是症结所在。好真正的我们必须研究这门学科的根本原因为什么事情变得更复杂了？随着频率增加正如我们对用户的指责然后波长变得与长度相似或甚至更短。所以我们正在使用它们必须对此作出解释。这就是我们正在研究的。希望如此虽然有很多非常空白环顾演讲厅希望这一点是清楚的。我们能应用交流电路理论吗你已经学了很多电路理论来分析这种情况，我们是如何做到的。

YesBut there are some requirement, some applying AC circuit theory. We will just be using certain theory. I said last week we will not be touching Maxwell's equations, bothBut that means there are restrictions of what we can analyze In this case, as long as it doesn't matter how long my transmission line isif I want to analyzebut the effects of the transmission line on my high frequency 6th, I need to break it into lots of smaller pieces where each piece must be significantly less than the wavelength I'm operating atAs long as I do that then I can sum up all of the or all of the contributions of all of my little pieces of transmission linethen I can apply circuit theory in that instance. In additionI also have to ensure my frequency doesn't get too highI say too highIn this case, we're probably talking about the tens of gigabytes, rightIf I go beyond thatlife gets more complicated against

是的但是有一些要求，一些应用交流电路理论。我们将只使用某些理论。我上周说过，我们不会触及麦克斯韦方程。两者都但这意味着我们可以分析的内容受到限制。在这种情况下，只要我的传输线有多长并不重要如果我想分析但是传输线对我的高频6号的影响，我需要把它分成很多小块。其中每一块必须明显小于工作时的波长只要我这么做。然后我可以总结所有的或者我所有的小部分的贡献传输线然后我可以在这种情况下应用电路理论。此外我还必须确保我的频率不会太高我说太高了。在这种情况下，我们谈论的可能是数十千兆字节，对吗？如果我超越了那个。生活变得更加复杂

We're not really going to be looking at anything in this class that is even remotely beyond, let's say, 20 gigahertz that probably be not for any purpose. But up to that, we're okay.  The problem becomesif the frequency gets too largeor indeed, if my cable is very lossythen it's not easy to model simply Again, I have to go back to Maxwell's equations and stop worrying about that Assuming we operated within a reasonable range of frequenciesBut you can get that this is quite helpful We assume that our transmission line is reasonably low lossThen we can go back to apply AC circuit theoryHow does my energy travel along the transmission line If it's a two wire lineit travels. But no matter what type of line it isit travels in the electromagnetic field generators It's actually traveling the conductors and travels in the field I think that was shown to you in Canada. And I thinkanyway, if we have a voltage applied between two conductors that will give rise to an electric fieldthat electric field will vary as the voltage varies along the length of the transmission line

我们不会在这门课上看到任何东西。即使远远超过，让我们说，20千兆赫，这可能不是为了任何目的但是到目前为止，我们还好。问题变成了如果频率太大或者实际上，如果我的电缆损耗很大那么简单地建模就不容易了。再一次，我必须回到麦克斯韦方程，不要再担心这个了。假设我们在合理的频率范围内工作但你可以知道这很有帮助。我们假设传输线的损耗相当低然后我们可以回去应用交流电路理论。我的能量是如何沿着传输线传播的？如果是双线线路它旅行但是不管是什么类型的线。它在电磁场发生器中传播。它实际上是在导体中传播，在磁场中传播。我认为那是在加拿大给你看的。而且我认为总之，如果我们在两个导体之间施加电压，就会产生电场。该电场将随着电压沿传输线长度的变化而变化

Similarlywe will have a current flowing in each of the conductors. The current will give rise to a magnetic field rotating around the windowsAgain, as the current varies along the line the size and direction of the magnetic field created will change for my small sections of low loss and not too high a frequency system I now apply kvl and kcl directly avra Mile kckbm I've been here a long time and I still can't remember how you pronounce his nameIn the UK, we see her jobHere, I think you say something like here called the I'm not sure anyway that jobs voted law, good jobs, current law and we now apply these to our transmission line Again, not entirely applying these rules is still going to be an approximationIt works well enoughIf the wave traveling along the line is tem, we discussed this last week, aten ways, remember, is one where the electric field is a magnetic field

同样地每个导体中都有电流流动。电流会上升。围绕窗户旋转的磁场。同样，当电流沿线路变化时，产生的磁场的大小和方向会改变适用于我国小断面低损耗且频率不太高的系统。我现在直接应用KVL和KCl自动电压调节器一英里KCKBM我在这里已经很久了，但我还是不记得你怎么念他的名字。在英国，我们看到她的工作在这里，我想你说的是这里叫做无论如何，我不确定乔布斯是否投票通过了法律，好工作，现行法律，我们现在将这些应用到我们的输电线路上。再说一次，不是完全地应用这些规则仍然是一种近似。它工作得很好。如果沿着这条线传播的波是TEM，我们上周讨论过，记住，是一种电场是磁场的方法。

The direction it's propagating are all right down As long as that is truethen we can apply kvlkcl standard circuit theoryAnd we get a result which is reasonably accurateIn theory, we should be applying Maxwell's equation If the wave is not tef, we have to apply maximum weightBut happy days, we will only be looking at tef wave this semester soonAgain, no Maxwell's equations. How can you help meWe will have voltages and currents that are all this form. They will be sinusoidal in nature. They will vary in time They will vary in spaceMost of the time we will be using phasesMost of it not only, but most of the time it will be considering phase notationAgain, I expect you to know what that is, but I guess we'll come back to it at some pointHere is my coaxial cable, and we saw this last week. Does this support tem wave propagationYes, it doesWe have an object conductor, blue outer circle. We have an inner conductor that is the green inner circleI apply a voltage between the two and a current flows along each of the conductors in opposite directions

它传播的方向都是向下的只要这是真的。然后我们可以应用KVLKCL标准电路理论和我们得到了一个相当准确的结果。理论上，我们应该应用麦克斯韦方程如果波浪不是TEF，我们必须施加最大重量但是快乐的日子，我们很快就会看到这个学期的TEF浪潮了。再说一次，没有麦克斯韦方程你能怎么帮我？电压和电流都是这种形式。它们本质上是正弦曲线。它们会随时间而变化。它们在空间上会有所不同。大多数情况下，我们将使用阶段。大多数时候，它不仅，而且大多数时候，它将考虑相位符号。再说一次，我希望你知道那是什么，但我想我们会在某个时候回到它。这是我的同轴电缆，我们上周看到了这个。这是否支持TEM波传播是的，它是我们有一个物体导体，蓝色的外圈。我们有一个内部导体，即绿色内圈。我在两个导体之间施加电压，电流以相反的方向沿着每个导体流动。

I get an electric field which extends from inner to outer, outer to innerdepending on the polarity voltage. And I have a magnetic field that is rotating around the inside of the conductor between the conductors,  which remains at right angles everywhere The wave is either propagating into or out of the transmission line Magnetic field is rotating around inside the insulator at right angles, and the electric field is pointing directly between the two conductorsAgain, at the right time I've picked a two wire transmission line for this stage. It doesn't really matter, but here we have two wires are cut it down.  I now have a length of wire that is very short, Delta that shortI want to generate a model using lumped element componentsDo we know? And I asked this every yearWhat's they lookedElements, components isDo you know what this term means a lot elements

我得到了一个从内到外，从外到内的电场。取决于极性电压。我有一个旋转的磁场。导体的内部在导体之间，处处保持直角波不是传播进就是传播出传输线磁场在绝缘体内以直角旋转，电场直接指向两个导体之间再次，在适当的时候我为这一阶段挑选了一条双线传输线。这并不重要，但这里有两根电线把它砍下来。我现在有一段很短的电线，德尔塔也很短。我想生成一个模型。使用集总元件元件我们知道吗？我每年都问这个问题他们在看什么元素，组件是你知道这个术语意味着什么吗？元素

When you go to the laboratory you build an electronic circuit you pick up a resistance that is a lumped elementWhen you take them to passenger, that is also a long element. It has some property It is all gathered together into one little item That's why we call it lumped. We looked the property together into something.  A resistor is a locked element, being passenger is a locked elementA transmission line is actually a distributed element systemBecause as much as we're going to model it using long elementsthose elements are stretched out along the length of the transmission lineso that it is a distributed elementsHere we want to look element model What types of components do I need in my modelin order to describe my transmission of anybody? I've just mentioned two components. Maybe they might be of an indication, perhapsAnyone help me out hereNo An inductor and the capacitorAbsolutelyTo come back to why in a momentAnyone elseOnly an inductor and a capacitorThe resistance, we have one person willing to put themselves out there.

当你去实验室的时候你建了一个电子电路。你遇到了抵抗。这是一个集总元件。当你把它们带给乘客时，这也是一个很长的元素。它有一些属性。所有这些都集中在一个小项目中。这就是为什么我们称它为集总。我们一起把房子看成了某种东西。电阻器是锁定元件，乘客是锁定元件传输线实际上是一个分布式元件系统。因为我们将使用长元素对其进行建模。这些元件沿着传输线的长度伸展所以它是一个分布式的元素在这里，我们想看看元素模型哪些类型的组件我需要在我的模型中为了描述我的传输任何人？我刚才提到了两个组成部分。也许他们可能是一种暗示，也许有人能帮我吗？不电感器和电容器绝对地一会儿再回到为什么？还有其他人吗只有一个电感和一个电容反抗军，我们有一个人愿意把自己放在那里

You can do itThere is one further component Here they are. I might as well put them up there being, as you see, but willing to participateWe have four components theretwo of them connected in seriestwo of them connected in parallel to this piece of transmission line on the Top here, this one looks like this model using local element componentsThey are the same thingNow that's how we are describing our transmission lineWhy are we describing it like that The conductors of the line are not perfect conductors. They will have possibly negligible they will have some resistanceThere will be some loss We have to introduce a resistancea series resistance into our model to describe that possible lossThe loss is actually her conductorSo both conductorswe'll have a resistor model that is representing themWe have an inductor in series. Why do we have an inductor in Syria? Why is it thereWhat is an inductorEssentially, what is it? Thank you so much

你能做到的还有一个组件他们来了。我还不如把它们放在那里。正如你所看到的，但愿意参与我们有那里有四个组件其中两个串联在一起其中两个是并联的到顶部的这条传输线，这一条看起来这个模型使用了局部元素组件。它们是一回事。这就是我们如何描述我们的传输线。我们为什么要这样描述它？线路的导体不是理想导体。他们会有的可能可以忽略他们会有一些抵抗。会有一些损失。我们必须引入一个阻力。串联电阻进入我们的模型来描述可能的损失。损失的其实是她的指挥。所以两个导体我们将有一个代表它们的电阻模型。我们有一个串联的电感器。为什么我们在叙利亚有一个感应器？它为什么在那里？什么是电感器？本质上，它是什么？非常感谢

Typically, when you see the conductor and as it's drawn there, there's a coil What does it doBasicallyit is a component that allows you to store some energy in a magnetic fieldAnd any conductor carrying a current will have a magnetic field.  It might be very small if it's not in a coin. But my conductors in my transmission line are most certainly carrying currentThey will have a magnetic field associated with.  I have to represent that inductance somewhere in my modelThe capacitor. Why do we have a capacitorAgain, what is the capacitorFundamentally, what is itIt's a component that has two conductors separated by insulatorThe component that allows me to stole some energy in an electrical field What is my transmission lineIt is two conductors separated by an insulatorIf I apply a voltage between the two conductorsI effectively get an electric field set up across the dielectricIt looks like a capacitor.  There it is. We need a capacitor What is the last element in there? My other parallel elementIt is a conductance

通常，当你看到导体时，当它被拉到那里时，就会有一个线圈。它是做什么的基本上是它是一种允许你在磁场中储存一些能量的组件。和任何导体携带电流会有磁场。如果不是硬币的话，它可能会很小。但是我的输电线路中的导体肯定是载流的。他们会的具有与..有关的磁场我必须在我的模型中的某个地方表示电感。电容器。我们为什么要有电容器？再问一次，电容是什么？从根本上说，它是什么？它是一个组件有两个由绝缘体隔开的导体能让我在电场中窃取能量的部件我的传输线是什么？它是由绝缘体隔开的两个导体如果我在两个导体之间施加电压我有效地在电介质上建立了一个电场。它看起来像一个电容器。它在那里。我们需要一个电容器。最后一个元素是什么？我的另一个平行元素它是一种电导。

We know what is a conductorIt's like a resistanceBut it tells us how something conducts It resists that tells you how something doesn't conductAnd the conductance tells you how about something does concernWhy is there a conductance in there Again, what is our transmission line? It is to conductors separated by a dielectric insulator is the insulator ideal It's notIt will allow a smallprobably negligible amount of current pass through it. It will have some loss That is why we have the conductance in there. It is there to represent the loss between the conductors through the dielectricEach of those extends over only my small section of transcription oneAll of them important people. Byebye. Sample have beenI look around the room, not many people smileSome people clearly watching video We have our modelWe're now going to apply kvlkcl in doing so we will obtain what are called the telegraphers equationsI'm not really interested in you doing thisnot gonna be tested at any., but you should know where these equations came from

我们知道什么是指挥。就像是一种抵抗。但它告诉我们一些东西是如何传导的。它抵抗告诉你某物如何不传导电导告诉你一些事情是怎么回事。为什么里面会有电导？再问一次，我们的传输线是什么？它是给指挥家的。由电介质绝缘体隔开绝缘体是否理想不是的它将允许一个小的通过它的电流可能可以忽略不计。它会有一些损失。这就是为什么我们在那里有电导。它用于表示导体之间通过电介质的损耗每一个都只延伸到我的一小部分抄本。他们都是重要人物。拜拜样本一直是我环顾房间，没有多少人微笑。有些人显然在看。视频我们有我们的模型。我们现在将应用KVLKCL，这样我们将得到所谓的电报员方程。我对你做这件事不感兴趣。不会在任何地方进行测试，但你应该知道这些方程是从哪里来的。

Here is my circuit. I apply a voltage in the input, and the current flows into the input that the output there is another voltage of a distance that is away and the current flowing outI apply kvl first the input voltage minus the voltage drop on the resistorminus the voltage drop of the inductorRemembering voltage on a doctor is determined by the differential of the currentnot essentially important here, but in case you would bring where that came fromminus the output voltage will give us zeroThat is a simple application of kvl. Started. Here we go around that loopKcothe current in to that bird is running through both the resistor and the inductor minus the current through the conductanceminus the current through the capacitorminus the current out must also be zero that is directly applying the current lawThe sum of currents of the node must equal zero

这是我的电路。我在输入端施加电压，电流流入输入端。那里的输出是另一个电压指的是远处的距离和流出的电流我先申请KVL输入电压减去电阻器上的电压降减去电感的电压降医生的记忆电压由电流的微分决定在这里并不重要，但如果你把它从哪里来减去输出电压将得到零。这是KVL的一个简单应用。开始了。在这里，我们绕着那个环。KCO, 进来的电流也就是说，鸟通过电阻和电感减去通过电导的电流。减去通过电容器的电流减去电流输出也必须为零那就是直接适用现行法律节点的电流总和必须等于零

Hopefully, we're all familiar with that Where can we go from there?  If we divide both of these by Delta Z and tencent towards zero, we end up with an expression that describes the differential of the voltage with distance in terms of the current and the differential of the current, actually, we end up with two expressions which are not very usefulrather complicated to solveDon't really help us very muchThey are important expressions. But they're not things that we are going to use. Insteadwe will take these expressions which have variation in both space that a time T we'll change them into phaser based expressionsNow, hopefully, I don't need to describe this, the phaserbasically, the sinusoid without the time dependenceas long as everything in my system is operating at the same frequency as the same time referencethen we don't need to care about the time. We can just ignore it as a variable and just describe things in terms of its other components

希望我们对此都很熟悉。我们能从那里去哪里？如果我们用Delta Z和Tencent将这两个值除以零，我们最终得到描述电压微分的一种表达式有了距离就电流和电流的微分，实际上，我们最终得到两个表达式，这两个表达式并不是很有用。解决起来相当复杂。对我们帮助不大它们是重要的表达方式。但是它们不是我们要用的东西。代替我们将采用这些表达式两者都有变化。时间t的空间我们将把它们变成基于相位器的表达式现在，希望我不需要描述这个，相位器基本上，没有时间依赖性的正弦曲线只要我的系统中的一切都以相同的频率和相同的时间基准运行那么我们就不需要关心时间。我们可以忽略它作为一个变量。只是用它的其他组成部分来描述事物。

Moving from these two expressions to the two of the bottom, all we've done is remove the time dependence when now describing the voltagesthe currents as phases, they have a size, they have an angleThat's all they have, then These start to look a little bit more easy to deal with. I have the differential of the voltage in that represented by the courage and saymaybe I could do something for that, and vice versa We're going to make them look a little bit more complicated in the first instance in order to get to a more simple solution in the second instance. If I take my first expression and I differentiate with respect to say, I now have a second order expression for votingBut I've also defined that in terms of the differential of the current I can take this substituted into here

从这两个表达式到底部的两个表达式，我们所做的就是在描述电压时消除时间相关性。电流作为相位，它们有大小，它们有角度那就是他们的全部了？这些开始看起来更容易处理。我有电压的微分。在那以勇气和说为代表也许我可以为此做点什么，反之亦然。我们将在第一个实例中使它们看起来更复杂一些，以便在第二个实例中获得更简单的解决方案。如果我拿着我的第一个表达式和我关于说的微分，我现在有一个投票的二阶表达式。但我也给它下了定义。就电流的微分而言我可以拿着这个。替换到这里

Now I have a vote. Now I have an expression which describes the second order differential, according in terms of voting that is something that is relatively easy to solveThere's a differential equation. Again, I'm not expecting you that I don't care whether you can do the mathematics or not, particularly important in this classI'm showing you this so that where it comes from, don't panic. You can't do that All we've done is rearrange this expression by substituting in my second order term for for the the voltage I end up with this at the bottom,  D squared be set by dz squared is equal to gamma squared. This is AA constant that I've just magic out of nowhere. It is described in terms of my circuits of my transmission line model circuit elements are L GC are the voltage applied? Is it

现在我有投票权了。现在我有一个描述二阶微分的表达式，根据在投票方面这是相对容易解决的问题。有一个微分方程。再说一次，我并不期望你们我不关心你们是否会做数学，这在这门课上尤其重要。我给你看这个，所以它是从哪里来的不要惊慌你不能这么做我们所做的就是重新排列这个表达式。在我的二阶术语中替换为为了电压我在底部结束了这个，d的平方被设置为DZ的平方等于伽玛平方。这是一个常数。我不知从哪里冒出来的魔法。它被描述为我的我的电路传输线模型电路元件为L气相色谱是施加的电压？是吗

Now, fortunately,  it is not that for the next slide, the I can do exactly the same thing to the other expression. And I end up with two second order derivations from the phaser notationsSo exactly the same thing to both sidesNow, I have something that describes current in terms of current and voltage, in terms of bullet. How many daysGammamy new constant is called the complex propagation possibleIt describes how things change with positionAgain,  it is made up of my circuit component elementsBut it's a complex number. And as a complex numberI can divide it into its real part and its imaginary partIt's real hard. We're going to call Alpha the attenuation concertAnd that's effectively going to govern how my voltage or current changes in its magnitudesize as a propagateAttenuation suggests things are going to get smaller. That's what things do when they are genuine How does my voltage or current get smaller as it propagate?

现在，幸运的是它不是对于下一张幻灯片，我可以对另一个表达式执行完全相同的操作。最后我从相位器符号中得到了两个二阶导数。所以对双方都是一样的。现在，我有一些描述电流的东西就电流和电压而言，就子弹而言。多少天伽玛我的新常数叫做可能的复数传播。它描述事物如何变化。有位置再次，它是由我的电路组件元素但它是一个复数。作为一个复数。我可以把它分成真实的部分。和它的虚部这真的很难。我们要打电话给阿尔法衰减音乐会这将有效地治理显示我的电压或电流变化在其规模上作为传播的大小衰减表明物体会变小。这就是当事情是真实的时候所做的。我的电压或电流在传播过程中是如何变小的？

That is what the attenuation comes from to describeThe complex part of my complex propagation constant is beta, the phase constantAnd that describes how the angle of my way changes as a propagate, how the angle of my voltage or current changes as it moves alongthe Chinese people are That's two parts to describe how things are going to changeRemember, a phaser only has information about size and angleGamma is telling us how the size and angle are going to change as we moveThe second order expressions, there are actually many solutions for being saidwho would satisfy these expressions solutions, which I can represent be said. I'm sorrysolutions in which I can represent the second differential of visa in terms of visathere are many options as solutions to that Here are the two options of in the one option. In each casemy visa component or my visa value is going to be represented by two thingsa forward voltage wave, a wave traveling in one direction along the transformation line.

这就是衰减的来源。我的复数传播常数的复数部分是β，相位常数这描述了我的路的角度如何改变作为传播，我的电压或电流的角度如何随着它的移动而变化中国人民是这是两个部分来描述事情将如何改变。记住，相位器只有信息关于尺寸和角度伽玛告诉我们当我们移动时，大小和角度会如何变化二阶表达式，其实有很多种说法。谁会满足这些表达？解决方案，我可以代表说对不起我可以表示VISA的二阶微分的解决方案在签证方面有很多选择。作为解决方案这里是一个选项中的两个选项。在每种情况下我的签证部分或我的签证价值将是由代表两件事正向电压波，沿变换线在一个方向上传播的波

And a backwardIt would be great I have two voltage waves. I have to account for a wave that can travel in either direction. My solution has to be general.  I have to have both of these waves in the in the solutionBut the first part of the strike, something traveling in one direction The second part described something traveling in the other directionThey describe the same types of thingsWe know plusin this case, tells you the initial size of my voltage phaser that's going to travel forward the exponential term that contains my complex propagation constant determines how that is going to change as in troubleSimilarly, for my backward traveling way, it has an initial size somewhere. And the exponential component tells me how it's going to change as it travels in the opposite directionI can say something very similar about the currentsforward traveling current and as backward traveling curve the first two terms, in each case, represents a wave that is propagating in the plus state direction

和一个落后会很棒的。我有两个电压波。我必须考虑一个可以向任何方向传播的波。我的解决方案必须是通用的。我必须让这两个波在解决方案中但罢工的第一部分，有东西朝一个方向移动第二部分描述了向另一个方向移动的物体。它们描述了相同类型的事物。我们知道加上在这种情况下，告诉你我的电压移相器的初始大小它会向前移动。包含复数传播常数的指数项决定了在麻烦中如何改变。同样，对于我的向后移动的方式，它在某处有一个初始大小和指数分量告诉我它将如何变化。因为它以相反的方向行进关于洋流，我可以说一些非常相似的话。正向行波电流并且作为向后行进的曲线在每种情况下，前两项表示在正状态方向上传播的波

The second two components represent waves traveling for propagating in the negative state directionLet's go with the what does that describe? Let's make sure we understand If we call this said equals zeroas we move through the semester, we will not be calling that Z equals zero, but just for this momentlet's go with 7 equals 0. We know plus is the initial size of my weightThis is my forward traveling way of calling it B plus, then the exponential term I've written in terms of its real and imaginary components If I was to plot that if I just look at the magnitude of this as as my week travels along the transmission line, I will have an exponential decayThat is what we see As my way troubles, it will get smallerIf it didn't get smalleragain, maybe you just won the Nobel prize because you have AA non active component giving you amplification.

第二个两个组成部分表示在负状态方向上传播的波让我们一起去那描述的是什么？我们一起确保我们明白。如果我们称这个等于零在这学期的学习中，我们不会说Z等于零，但只是为了这一刻。让我们用7等于0来计算。我们知道加是我体重的初始大小那么，这就是我称之为B+的前进方式。指数项我已经根据它的实部和虚部写出来了。如果是我策划的如果我只看大小这个的如同当我的一周沿着传输线行进时，我将有一个指数衰减。这就是我们所看到的当我的路遇到麻烦时，它会变小。如果它没有变小再一次，也许你刚刚获得诺贝尔奖，因为你有一个非活性成分给你放大。

It's not possibleCan only get smaller as it travels through the translationIf we just consider the angle the angle of my wave will changeagain, controlled by the exponential termPeter is a constantand that increasesThe phase value will also increaseLet's just remember the fee gives rise to E I could represent this as a voltage or as an electric fieldBut not we're going to stick with both to use, but I could do either in terms of the currentsimilar thing, we have an initial currentThe magnitude of the current will decay exponentially as I travel along the transmission lineAnd the things will also change as I travel along the transmission, currentI could represent as a magnetic fieldmy choicewe will likely stick with currents throughout if you don't like electric and magnetic fields, it doesn't matterThat will be dealing with voltages and current

这不可能当它通过平移时只能变得更小如果我们只考虑角度我波浪的角度会改变。同样，由指数项控制彼得是一个常数。而且还在增加相位值也将增加让我们记住费用产生E我可以将其表示为电压或电场。但不是我们要坚持两个都用，但我可以两个都用。就目前而言类似的事情，我们有一个初始电流当I沿着传输线行进时，电流的大小将呈指数衰减还有那些东西也会改变当我沿着变速器行进时当前的我可以用磁场来表示我的选择我们可能会始终坚持海流。如果你不喜欢电场和磁场，那也没关系。这将涉及电压和电流。

Now, something else that's important in these two expressions in the way that they're written are those operationsThe voltage is B, says it's written as a sum of 2 volt ich wei'sWhere is the current? I sayis written as the subtraction of two current wavesPeople get confused by this. And I I'd like to make it clear as to why this is the caseYou would never do this This is just for demonstration purposesIf I attach the voltage source to both ends of my transmission line, you would never ever do thisBut just assume those two voltage sources are out putting the same frequency with the same size at the same time.  They are both in phaseI connect them to my transmission line in exactly the same way The positive end of phase voltage source is attached here, and the positive end of this voltage source is attached in. The two voltages are applied in exactly the same way to my transmission line when they meet in that case.

现在，在这两个表达的书写方式中，还有一些重要的东西。是那些运营电压是B，表示它写成2伏的总和，即水流在哪里？我说写成两个电流波相减人们对此感到困惑。我想说清楚为什么会这样。你永远不会这么做。这只是为了演示的目的。如果我将电压源连接到传输线的两端，你永远不会这样做。但假设这两个电压源同时输出相同的频率和相同的大小。它们都是同相的。我以完全相同的方式将它们连接到我的传输线上。相电压源的正端接在这里，这个电压源的正端接在。这两个电压以完全相同的方式施加到我的传输线上。当他们在那种情况下见面时。

So the electric fields pointing in the same directionWhen they meet, they must act together if they are in faiththey will couple together. I will have electric fields pointing in the same direction. These will add together. I will get a larger voltage The voltage is traveling in opposite directions must be written as a summationbecause I apply them to the transmission line in exactly the same wayIs that clearIf it's not clear and you don't care, then don't care. Just remember the expression holding or eaten Why do my current subtractIs the questionLet's say, again, I have exactly the same system. Now I'm flying exactly the same current to both ends of the transmission linethe currents will produce magnetic fields that are rotating in the opposite directionsbecause the currents are traveling in opposite directions Therefore, when the currents meet and are in phase, they must be subtractingThe two magnetic fields will cancel each other out that the same sizeas long as the currents are in faith.

所以电场指向同一个方向。当他们相遇时，如果他们有信仰，他们必须一起行动。他们会结合在一起。我会让电场指向同一个方向。这些会加在一起。我会得到更大的电压。电压以相反的方向传播必须写成求和因为我以完全相同的方式将它们应用于传输线清楚了吗如果不清楚，你不关心，那就不关心。只要记住“抱着”或“吃掉”的表达。为什么我的当前减法这是个问题让我们再次说，我有完全相同的系统。现在我正以完全相同的电流飞行到传输线的两端电流将产生以相反方向旋转的磁场。因为电流的方向是相反的。因此，当电流相遇且同相时，它们必须相减两个磁场将相互抵消。同样的尺寸。只要洋流还在信仰中。

So we write the expression for the total current as a subtraction rather than otherwiseI debated whether or not to remove these arrows from my slide because they may be misleading a little bitIn theory, to work out the current director, the magnetic field direction. Here, we should look at every point around the conductor to see which way it's going on This kind of just generalized as an electromagnetic wave Anywaythe point is, the two magnetic fields produced are pointing at opposite directions, because the currents of traveling physically in opposite directions they will subtract.  That's it Questions about any of that? Have been you'll get through this section and then we'll have a break We've described our systemWe understood the problem. As frequency increases.  We worked out how to analyze the translation line. Let's just look at a couple of transmission line properties. Again, you've seen this wholethe first and probably most important property here is the characteristic of peoples of the transmission line

所以我们把总电流的表达式写成减法。而不是其他我争论是否要从我的幻灯片中删除这些箭头，因为它们可能会产生一些误导。从理论上讲，要算出电流方向，磁场方向。在这里，我们应该观察导体周围的每一点，看看它是朝哪个方向发展的。这种只是泛化作为电磁波无论如何重点是，产生的两个磁场指向相反的方向，因为电流在物理上以相反的方向传播他们会减去就是这样有什么问题吗？一直是你先读完这一部分，然后我们休息一下。我们已经描述了我们的系统我们明白了这个问题。随着频率增加。我们解决了如何分析翻译线的问题。让我们来看几个传输线特性。再一次，你已经看到了整个这里的第一个也可能是最重要的属性是民族特色的传输线。

Characteristic impedanceIt's a material propertyIt is not an impedance like you are thinking you might use as a lowIt's not likely resistant. It does not use energyIt presents an opposition to a wave propagatedIt does not use the energy of the way is different to over impedance is you are familiar It effectively makes the wedding slow down The wave is trying to propagate through something, any material The characteristic impedance to say,  don't travel quite so fastThat's effectively what characteristic impedance is aboutWe can derive an expression for characteristic impedance going back to our selective equationgo back to the phase of allIf we substitute our solutions for these, and I said it again, and differentiate the visa That's what it is.  We get this expression of the bottom. Again, I I'm not expected to do thisIf you want to follow it through, you can spend some time with yourselfCharacteristic of people's of a material is something that operates on a specific wave

特性阻抗这是一种物质属性。它不是一个阻抗，就像你想的那样，你可能会用它来降低它不太可能有抵抗力。它不使用能源。它呈现出一种对立。到传播的波它不使用方式的能量。不同于过阻抗是你所熟悉的它有效地使婚礼慢下来。波试图通过任何物质传播。也就是说，特性阻抗不会传播得那么快。这实际上就是特性阻抗。我们可以推导出特性阻抗的表达式。回到我们的选择性方程。回到所有的阶段如果我们用我们的解决方案来代替这些，我再说一遍和分化签证就是这样。我们得到底层的这种表达。再说一次，我不希望这样做。如果你想坚持到底，你可以花些时间和自己在一起。人们的特点一种材料是对特定的波起作用的东西。

It is not operating on the entire system of waves at one time. It is operating on specific waves Here we have the forward way, the reflect the backward way, forward way, backward wayCharacteristic impedance is going to function on each way independently we can pull out the forward waves, we can pull out the backward wavesand write those expressionsCharacteristic impedance is going to relate the forward voltage to the forward current It's going to relate the backward voltage to the backward curveWe can separate the two things out of this expressionThis gives rise to this currently does not give rise to anything in this expression There are two separate thingsIf we take these two expressions and find the ratio of voltage, the current, in each case, you will see the solution is the sameCharacteristic impedance of the transmission line is determined, in terms of, again, my model components, rlgcfor a lossless transmission line.

它不是一次对整个波系统进行操作。它在特定的波浪上运行。在这里我们有前进的方式，反映落后的方式，前进的方式，落后的方式特性阻抗将起作用在每条路上都是独立的。我们可以拉出向前的波浪，我们可以拉出向后的波浪写下这些表达。特性阻抗将与正向电压与正向电流之比它将把反向电压与反向曲线联系起来。我们可以把这两件事从这个表达式中分离出来。这就产生了这个当前不会在此表达式中产生任何内容有两件不同的事情。如果我们取这两个表达式，并求出电压和电流的比值，在每种情况下，你会看到解是相同的。传输线的特性阻抗也是根据我的模型元件RLGC来确定的对于无损耗传输线。

And in most cases, this semesterwhen I say most I96% Using a random number there96% of caseswe will be looking at lossless lines always if the line is lost thisthat means the resistor in our model is zeroThe resistor is there to describe the the lossthe sea results G is equal to zero, a conductance that is there to describe the loss through the dielectric For a lossless line, R and G are equal to zero. My characteristic impedance reduces the root L over CSetting R and G to zero also has an impact on our complex propagation comesIt is now purely imaginary. There is no Alpha to Alpha is equal to zeroWhat was output the attenuation constantIt told you how the wave was going to change in magnitude as a propagatorIf the system is losslessthere should be no change in magnitude

在大多数情况下，这学期当我说大多数I96%在那里用一个随机数96%的案件如果线路丢失，我们将始终查看无损线路。这意味着我们模型中的电阻为零。电阻用于描述损失SEA结果G等于零，这是描述通过电介质的损耗的电导对于无损线，R和G等于零。我的特性阻抗减少了C的根L。将R和G设置为零也会影响我们的复杂传播来了它现在纯粹是虚构的。没有α到α等于零。输出是什么衰减常数它告诉你波浪的大小将如何变化。作为传播者如果系统是无损的幅度应该没有变化。

Hence, out, there is equal to zero. If R and G are equal to zero, we only have the face to face term must existThe angle of the wave must change as a propagate, whether we defined as the this is what the phase constant describes the angle of the way as a function of positionIt has units of radians per meter Now we get into one of them as well. And then for an aspectthe wavelength of a wave traveling in a mediumIt's not the same as the wavelength of the same wave traveling in free spaceWe have lambda G, what we call the guided wavelengththe wavelength of my source on the transmission lineSo generallywe regard wavelength as being Cspeed of light to the vacuum divided by XThat is the wavelength in free space for London North. We can callAs soon as we introduce a medium that has a relative permittivity that is not equal to one

因此，OUT等于零。如果R和G都等于零，我们只有面项必须存在波的角度必须随着传播而改变是否我们定义为这就是相位常数描述作为位置函数的道路角度它的单位是弧度/米。现在我们进入其中一个也是。然后对于一个方面在介质中传播的波的波长它与在自由空间中传播的相同波的波长不同。我们有λg，我们称之为导波波长。传输线上光源的波长所以一般来说我们认为波长是C真空中的光速除以X这是伦敦北部自由空间的波长。我们可以打电话只要我们引进一种媒介其相对介电常数不等于1。

Then the way it slows down the impact of the way it's slowing down is that the wavelength changes Lambda G represents the wavelength of all the wave on the transmission lineIncidentallyif the wave slows downshould the wavelength get longer or shorter for the same frequency, most of the. Are you sure lambda equals V divided by FIf the velocity gets slower B gets smallerLambda gets smaller locally Lambda G, we can find by looking at how far away moves into chi radiance,  two pi divided by heaterIt would be this expression for lambda G one over X times group LCNowsimultaneously to thatHow fast is the way traveling Really, we're asking, how fast is my.P? How fast is my server move along my transmission line like any velocity, we can determine that is changing distance over changing time. Right? That is the standard expression for velocity for a wavewe know that for a movement of lambdait will take one time period for the week

然后它慢下来的方式它变慢的影响是波长发生了变化。λg表示传输线上所有波的波长顺便说一下如果波浪慢下来波长应该变长还是变短？对于相同的频率大部分的你确定吗λ等于V除以F如果速度达到慢一点B变小Lambda得到局部较小Lambda G，我们可以通过观察移动的距离来发现成气光辉，两皮除以暖气。这就是λG的表达式X上的一个时代集团LC现在与此同时旅行的速度有多快？真的，我们在问，我的.P有多快？我的服务器移动速度有多快沿着我的传输线像任何速度一样，我们可以确定距离随着时间的变化而变化。对的？这是速度的标准表达式。为了一个波浪这点我们知道对于λ的移动一周需要一段时间。

So effectivelyVP the philosophy of which.he will move is lambda G divided by T for lambda gdfSee, the expression we started with B equals lambda XFrom the previous slidewe just derived an expression for lambda G one over a group to LC. That tells me that then we move over straightforward Do we need to care about things? This is just an alternative way of looking at it. So we can ignore that for now. You can look at that in your own timeThe same thingjust an alternative way of getting But the last line is relatively useful hereWe also know from last week that in a dielectric object and materialthe velocity of all the way is C divided by root epsilon R We can also say lambda Gthis C divided by root epsilon raThese are useful expressions for youBefore we stop for break timeI recognize there are lots of equations in this classlots of useful way

如此有效VP.他将移动的哲学是Lambda G除以T对于Lambda GDF看，我们从B开始的表达式等于lambda X上一张幻灯片我们刚刚推导出了λg的表达式一组到LC。这告诉我，然后我们就过去了直接了当我们需要关心事情吗？这只是另一种看待它的方式。所以我们现在可以忽略它。你可以在你自己的时间里看看。同样的事情只是另一种获得但是最后一行。在这里比较有用。我们从上周也知道在电介质物体中材料所有路径的速度都是C除以根epsilon R我们也可以说λG这个C除以根epsilon Ra这些是对你有用的表达。在我们停下来休息之前我知道这门课上有很多方程式。很多有用的方法

When it comes to your exam. And throughout the semester, I will produce a list of useful formulasAlmost all of the formulas you will need for your exam will be provided in the examAlmostI'm gonna tell you all, but you will have seen, you will see the formula sheet that is in the examBefore the exam, you will know what is that Panic too much about having to remember all of the equation You certainly don't need to remember the derivation is not contesting the relation many. Now it is true That's because of the amount of stuff we have to go through. Let's have just a 5 minute break today. Sorry, usually I will have a 10 minute break. And from next week it will be tempting, but next weekwe will just have 5 minutes

当你考试的时候。在整个学期中，我会列出有用的公式考试中将提供您考试所需的几乎所有公式几乎我会告诉你们所有人，但你们会看到，你们会看到考试中的公式表。在考试之前，你会知道那是什么。因为必须记住所有的方程式而过于恐慌你当然不需要记住，推导并不是对许多关系的质疑。现在是真的了。那是因为我们必须经历大量的事情。今天让我们休息5分钟。对不起，通常我会休息10分钟。从下周开始，这将是诱人的，但下周我们只有5分钟。

03月04日 10时06分


Almost all I've heard is my voice, not very happy about that

我听到的几乎都是我的声音，对此不太高兴。

I really do want you to ask questions and join inUltimately, it's your choice. I can't pause the I could, but you wouldn't be very happyHopefully, as the semester rolls forwardthings will become more interactive

我真的很想让你问问题并加入进来。最终，这是你的选择。我不能暂停我可以，但你不会很高兴希望随着学期的推进事物将变得更加互动。

Now we're going to look at reflections. We kind of finished defining our transmission line, and we built expressions that describe voltage and current variation in terms of phasesaloneI showed the diagram in the first half that had two voltage sources attached to the ends of the transmission line and said that's the stupid systemForget that you ever saw that other than to understand why both of these AD in terms of strategyHere is really what we're representing with our forward and backwardsTraveling both We consider this is a transmission lineThis year in the middle is a transmission line. I put II attach it to a source of provider voltage to the lineIt travels up the lineI have my incident waves incident forward, probably goingAt the end of the line, I have an impedance

现在我们来看看反射。我们完成了对传输线的定义，并建立了描述电压和电流变化的表达式。就阶段而言单独的我展示了前半部分的图表，其中有两个电压源连接到传输线的两端，并说愚蠢的系统忘记你曾经看到过，而不是理解为什么这两个广告在战略方面这就是我们前进和后退所代表的东西。两者都在旅行我们认为这是一条传输线。今年中间是一条传输线。我把II将其连接到线路的电源电压它沿着线往上走。我让我的入射波向前入射，可能是在线的末端，我有一个阻抗

And from this moment forwardas long as we are talking about science or oil steady state systems, say it will equal zero afternoon for the rest of the semesternext week will be one deviation from thatThank you so little steady state sourcesSo that sources that have non zero frequency we will regard the end of the line that the low end of the line, that's what I said equals zero. What happens when my way hits the low Let's make the question easierI attach a source to this end I I don't attach anything to this I have a generator, a source that is pumping energy into one end of my transmission lineIt travels along the transmission line, it definitely travelsWhat happens when it gets hereThere's nothing hereDon't see anythingIt's an open circuit. What happens hereDoes it magically disappear Does it broadcast itself out of the end of the line and the trouble of towards the the edge of the universe

从这一刻起只要我们谈论的是科学或石油稳态系统快说将等于零下午在剩下的学期里下周将是一个偏离这一点。谢谢你这么小的稳态来源。所以那些有非零频率我们将认为这条线的末端，这条线的低端，这就是我所说的等于零。当我的方式陷入低谷时会发生什么？让我们把问题变得简单一些。为此，我附上了一个来源。我不会对此附加任何东西我有一台发电机，一种能产生能量的能源我的传输线的一端它沿着输电线移动，它肯定会移动。当它到达这里时会发生什么？这里什么都没有什么都看不见这是开路。这里发生了什么它会神奇地消失吗？它会把自己广播到队尾吗？的麻烦朝着宇宙的边缘

What happens to itThe clue was in the name of this section reflections. It is reflectedThe energy cannot disappearMore conservation of energy, you cannot create or destroy itYou can only convert it from one form to another. The energy is traveled along the transmission line. It reaches the endSome of itpossibly all of it could be used by the loan that I attached theremore likely some of it will be reflected back along the lineI now have two ways traveling along the line. This now represents my voltage and current equations that I've just derived. I have an incidentally voted and again, something will happen and I will get a reflected way involved. Two ways troubling in opposite directions, or would we and the backward way for accurately described as a reflected waveThese are my two component wavesThe ones described by my voltage and current equationsLet's describe them a little bit further and develop the idea of something called a reflection coefficient

它会发生什么？线索就在这节反思的名字里。它被反映出来能量不会消失。更多的能量守恒，你不能创造或毁灭它。您只能将其从一种形式转换为另一种形式。能量沿着传输线传播。它到达终点其中一些可能是全部。可以用我附在那里的贷款更有可能的是，其中一些会沿着这条线反射回来。我现在沿着这条线有两种旅行方式。这表示我刚刚推导出的电压和电流方程。我顺便投了一票和再一次，有些事情会发生，我会以一种反思的方式参与其中。两条路相向而行，或将我们和后路。为了准确地描述为反射波这是我的两个分量波我的电压和电流方程所描述的让我们进一步描述一下它们。并提出了反射系数的概念。

A very important term, as far as our module is concernedHere is my voltage expression, as I just derived beforeI can represent the forward voltage as its component of term. And I reflected voltagewe know minus the exponential term in here, not as an additional I'm intrigued to know does anybody know what this this character, this brief letter is called you will be able to only use it today. We won't use it again. So I'm wonderingyou can either call it psi or Cdepends whether your an English person trying to sound great or you're a great person, but it is effectively can see you are freeNot important. Just wonder if you do what the Greek letter wasHe represents an additional phase component on the reflected way. And that phase component is due to whatever the load is The gamma terms. Rememberthat represents how the way changes as it propagated along the lineThis conceived components is just phase at this moment It describes any phase change due to the law specifically to the lawremembering that Z equals zero capital,  we could substitute Z equals zero in here to get the expressions that directed just describe the initial state of our way to an instant way, just has a magnitude

一个非常重要的术语，就我们的模块而言这是我的电压表达式，正如我之前推导的那样我可以将正向电压表示为术语的组成部分。和I反射电压我们知道负的这里的指数项，不是额外的我很好奇，有人知道这是什么吗？这个字符，这个简短的字母被称为你将能够只在今天使用。我们不会再用它了。所以我在想您可以将其称为PSI或C取决于你的一个英国人试图让自己听起来很棒，或者你是一个很棒的人，但事实就是如此。实际上可以看到你是自由的。不重要。只是想知道你是否知道希腊字母是什么。他代表一个额外的相位分量在反射的路上。且无论负载是什么，相位分量都是由于伽马项。记得，它表示路径在沿线传播时如何变化。这个构想组件目前只是一个阶段。它描述了任何相位变化因法具体到法记住Z等于零资本，我们可以代入这里的Z等于零，得到的表达式指向描述我们的初始状态到瞬间的方式，只是有一个量级。

I will reply the way as a magnitude and potentially a phase valueNow, the reflection coefficient is defined as the ratio of reflected voltage to, incidentallywe look at that We have the magnitude divided by a magnitude. We don't minus divided by V, don't close, and some possible things valueWe call it capital gamma We have two gamma is, unfortunately, we have little gamma in this module, which is the complex propagation culture We have capital gamma that represents reflection coefficient in this slide that in the next few slidesit is written as gamma V, because gamma V is the voltage reflecting coefficientWe will see in a moment to gamma Iwhich is a current reflection coefficientAnd then after today, I will likely only refer to capital gamma as being the voltage reflection coefficient. And we will never talk about current reflection coefficients againSo gamma V today will move itself simply into gamma later for the detailed right

我会回复的作为幅度和潜在的相位值的方式现在，反射系数被定义为反射电压的比率顺便说一句我们看看那个。我们用震级除以震级。我们不减去除以V，不接近，并且一些可能的东西值我们称之为资本伽玛。我们有两个伽玛，不幸的是，我们在这个模块中几乎没有伽玛，这是复杂的繁殖文化。我们有代表反射系数的大写字母γ。在下面几张幻灯片中写成γV，因为γV是电压反射系数我们马上就会看到伽马I。其是电流反射系数今天之后，我可能只会提到资本伽玛。作为电压反射系数。我们再也不会讨论电流反射系数了。所以今天的伽马V会自己移动。简单地进入伽玛稍后为详细的权利

We can rewrite our expression for BThe total voltage on the line at any position saidin terms of my incident wayAnd the exponential that describes how luckyGamma V, which tells me how my incidentally turns into my reflective way Again, the exponential term that tells me how that changes as it moves along the transmissionWe can say very similar things about the current. Again, I'm not going to read through all of this, though. There are so specificThere is, again, an additional phase value insert. It is inserted on both the forwardthe incident wave and the reflected wave batteries. Are you Is that Delta represents a phase difference between voltage and current if there is oneNo, that will only be a phase difference on the transmission line between voltage and current. The same wayIf the transmission line has a characteristic impedance that is complexand in all casesthat we will see the transmission line characteristic impedance is only a real number, has no complex part.

我们可以重写B的表达式线上任何位置的总电压表示就我的事件方式而言和描述幸运程度的指数伽玛V，这告诉我我的偶然如何变成我的反思方式同样，指数项告诉我，当它沿着传输移动时，它是如何变化的关于电流，我们可以说非常相似的事情。再说一次，我不打算通读所有这些内容。有的如此具体同样，还有一个额外的相位值插入。它插入在两个前部上入射波和反射波电池是吗那是Delta表示电压和电流之间的相位差（如果有的话）不，那只是传输线上电压和电流之间的相位差。同样的方式如果传输线具有复杂的特性阻抗，在所有情况下我们将看到传输线特性阻抗只是一个实数，没有复数部分。

Therefore, Delta will always be zeroBut for fullness of expressionit is in here you get after today you will never see that againThe minus sign that the subtracting minus sign and my total current expression that is imparted into my expression for gamma Ithe current reflection coefficient, it is done. So by adding an additional pi tutor and facialThe expression I can represent, I said, at the bottom therein terms of something that looks very much the same as the voltage expression and adding on the reflected wave multiply by gamma I, which contains the-4 that we see in the first expert It is encompassed all insideRemember that the characteristic impedance of the line Z zero is equal to the ratio of voltage to current of either the incident wave, all the reflected waveit can help an angle DeltaIf that zero is complexbut again, it will typically be zero

因此，Delta将始终为零而是为了充分表达。它就在这里，今天之后你再也不会看到它了。减去负号和我的总电流表达式的负号这被赋予了我的伽玛I的表达式。电流反射系数，它是这样做的。所以通过增加一个额外的π家教和面部护理表情我可以代表，我说，在底部看起来与电压表达式非常相似再加上反射波乘以gamma I，其中包含我们在第一个专家身上看到的4它被包围了都在里面请记住，线路Z零点的特性阻抗等于电压与电流之比两者之一入射波，所有的反射波它可以帮助角度δ如果那个零是复数但同样，它通常为零

The impedance of the lawThis is importantIf you have an actual lumped element in peace, this is a real impedance. Then that is described by the total voltageHow many things divided by the total current through that? It means at any particular time,  say there will be equal to the total voltage at 70 divided by the total current that equals zero. We have to sumThe incident was reflected waves together at that.We can represent the eyes by considering those expressions of them we can use the relationship between the high and the characteristic impedanceWe can take those two results and combine them together Finally flipped over and around. We end up with an expresso on voltage, reflection coefficient gamma in terms of just the impedance of the system for me to care about the voltages anymore. If I know the load impedance I know the characteristic impedance of the line, then my reflection coefficient can be calculated by that expression

法律的阻抗这很重要如果你有一个真正的集总元件，这就是一个真正的阻抗然后这是由总电压描述的有多少事除以通过它的总电流？意思是在任何特定时间，假设将等于70处的总电压除以总电流等于零。我们必须总结。那次事件是一波一波的反射。我们可以代表眼睛。通过考虑他们的那些表情我们可以利用高阻抗和特性阻抗之间的关系我们可以取这两个结果。并将它们结合在一起。终于翻了个身。我们最后喝了一杯浓咖啡电压，反射系数γ，就系统的阻抗而言，我不再关心电压了。如果我知道负载阻抗我知道线路的特性阻抗，那么我的反射系数就可以通过这个表达式计算出来。

In this expression said L can range from zero to infinity If not, it seems gamma can take values from-1 to 1If you end up with a voltage reflection coefficient that has a size which is greater than oneYou've done something wrongBecause what you're suggesting is the reflection is larger than the incident way. That means you are amplifying the signal that is unlikely the case in anything we are going to do A reflection coefficient should always have a magnitude of one or smallerWe could show that gamma I is equal to minus that is in space formula and had their own minus guarantee. Again, we're not going to do thatJust French fashionThe last property on the property, not property in the transmission line, but the last parameter that we might be interested in terms of our analysis is something called vswr voltage standing wave ratioIt tells us the ratio between the maximum voltage on the line and the minimum voltage on the line as a magnitude we can do it.

在该表达式中，所述L的范围可以从零到无穷大如果不是，伽玛似乎可以从-1到1取值如果你最终得到一个电压反射系数具有大于1的大小的你做错事了。因为你的意思是反射比入射方向大。这意味着你在放大信号。那是在我们将要做的任何事情中都不太可能。反射系数应始终具有大小。一个或更小的我们可以证明伽玛I等于负数这是在空间公式，并有自己的负保证。再说一次，我们不会这么做。只是法国时尚最后一个财产上的财产，不是财产中的传输线，而是最后的参数根据我们的分析，我们可能感兴趣的是所谓的VSWR电压驻波比它告诉我们线路上的最大电压和最小电压之间的比率。作为一个量级我们能做到的。

Actually, V max over V min or I max over I will actually produce exactly the same value. But we typically talk in terms of both hands pswNo need to go through the derivation. It is just simple algebra manipulatedIt comes out that the vsw are is related to the magnitude of the reflection coefficient. I want both gamma divided by one minus gammaAnd conversely, if I have the vsw well of a system I can find out the gamma bugAgain, that's just facing algebra, manipulate V swl is probably less important than it used to be. It is a figure of merit that are effective as youVery typically, somebody will build the systemThey will vote for youThe psw are of the system, and that as an engineer and our engineer, would give you an idea of how efficient the system isWe will come back to using pswr and maybe week six

实际上，V Max/V min或I Max/I将产生完全相同的值。但我们通常用双手说话。PSW, 不需要经过推导。这只是简单的代数操作。结果是VSW是与反射系数的大小有关。我要两个伽玛除以1减去伽玛。相反，如果我有一个系统的VSW井我可以找出伽马虫。再一次，这只是面对代数，操纵V SWL为可能没以前那么重要了。这是一个像你一样有效的优点。非常典型的是，有人会建立系统他们会投你的票。PSW是系统的一部分，作为一名工程师和我们的工程师，可以让您了解系统的效率。我们将回来使用PSWR，也许是第六周

I'm just giving you the expression for todayI don't expect you to have a good feeling for a special case of my system hereis it that L is equal to Z zeroWhat happens if my load of beans is equal to the characteristic impedance of the systemWhat happensOr based on the expression I've just arrivedthe value of gamma will be zeroRemember, the Top line of that expression was gamma equals zl minus Z zero If they are equalbut gamma must be zeroThat means the reflection must be zero. And therefore, I only have an incident wavethe old jobsno reflectionNo energy is lostThat tells me all of the incident way goes into the load and is used by the load. This is what we wantwhat we always want, but we're designing when trying to get power from a sourcethrough a network, whatever the network is into a load to do something

我只是给你今天的表达方式。我不指望你对..有好感一个特例我的系统在这里是不是l等于Z零？如果发生了什么我的豆子负载等于系统的特性阻抗。发生了什么或者基于我刚到的表达。伽马的值将为零。记住，表达式的第一行是γ等于ZL减去Z0。如果它们相等但伽马必须为零。那意味着反射必须为零。因此，我只有一个入射波以前的工作没有反射没有能量损失。这告诉我所有的事件方式进入负载并由负载使用。这就是我们想要的。我们一直想要的，但我们正在设计当试图获得电源从一个来源通过网络，无论网络是什么，都可以为负载做一些事情。

We want as much of that power to arrive in the load as possibleIf there is a reflected wave in this instancethen the reflection is simply wasted power. It is power not being used by the law A lot of this semester will be dedicated to seeing how we can ensure that all of the power ends in the lawregardless of what the system actually isit is very unlikelyI I can tell youcharacteristic impedance of this line is 50 ohms. There's actually only two common characteristic impedance is the transmission lines, 50 ohms75 ohms depends if you're using if you're working in satellite communications or for the communication Your mode is designed to do somethingIt is unlikely to haveI think he is equal to 50 or 75, very unlikely If you just connect the load to a transmission line, you will end up with reflectionThat means you're losing energy desirable, not to do so.

我们希望尽可能多的能量到达负载中。如果在这种情况下存在反射波那么反射只是浪费了能量。这是不为法律所用的权力。这学期的很多时间都会用来看我们如何才能确保所有的权力都在法律中终结？不管系统实际上是什么。这不太可能。我可以告诉你。这条线的特性阻抗是50欧姆。实际上只有两种常见的传输线特性阻抗，50欧姆75欧姆这取决于你是否使用如果你从事卫星通讯或为了交流你的模式被设计来做某事。它不太可能有我认为他等于50或75，非常不可能。如果你只是把负载连接到传输线上，你最终会得到反射。这意味着你正在失去能量。可取的，不这样做。

We will learn how we can manipulate the system in order to ensure that loss of energy There are some examples that I would like you to do during the week, and I will go through the solutions to the example next week. It will be easier for you to do those examples in your own time, because you will have to look back through the the lecture notes to find the relevant expression that being.  How is itSo that you don't have the answer notesThe answers are not in the PDF that you have access to onlineAgain, we were going to complain to be Frank, I don't care Feel free to complain as much as you likegiving you the answers directly does not help you. I will go through the answers on the slides next week in the class

我们将学习如何操纵系统为了确保能量损失有一些例子，我想让你做在这一周里，我将在下周讨论这个例子的解决方案。对你来说，在你自己的时间里做这些例子会更容易，因为你必须回顾在课堂讲稿中找到相关的表达。那是怎么样所以你不知道答案笔记答案不在您可以在线访问的PDF中再一次，我们要抱怨。坦率地说，我不在乎。你可以尽情抱怨。直接给你答案对你没有帮助。我会在下周的课堂上过一遍幻灯片上的答案。

It is far better learning experience for you to go away and try and answer the questions yourselfThey are not complicated questions, actually, that really, very simple. But it is better. You try them without the solutions. FirstI will provide you the solutions laterThe counting is beginning. How can I goJust come away, don't worryIn case you thought I was lyingin case you wanted to test whether I was going to do it or notHere they countingYou go onOkay Please try the example in the site. Before next week I will go through those examples next week Now we're going to have a look at the input impedance. This is an old thing to be discussingWe've described the system in terms of voltage and currents. We've described the properties of the transHere is my transmission line system. It's exactly the same as previous and has a generator. I have my transmission line I have my load of theseI did some of the shipping. It is Slinethat Alpha is equal to zerothen my complex propagation constant is just for the complex value, J betamy expressions for these. And I said, in that instance, reduced to, as shownI I've left the exceed variable in there for nowas the phase imparted on the incident way by the below in order to generate the reflected waveAgain, as with every other side, I don't require you to go through the derivation processIt is here just so that where it iswhat we are doing is deriving an expression that can represent the input impedance to the system I'm interested to know what does the generator seeI have my generatorI have the transmission line of the lawI connect the generator to this end of the transmission line. What impedance does it seemDoes it see the load impedanceDoes it see the characteristic impedance of the lineDoes it see something else? That's what we are generating expressions for now

对你来说，离开并尝试自己回答问题是更好的学习经验。它们不是复杂的问题，实际上，真的很简单。但是这样更好。你在没有解决方案的情况下尝试它们。第一稍后我将为您提供解决方案。计数开始了。我怎么走？走吧，别担心以防你认为我在撒谎。如果你想测试不管我会不会这么做。在这里他们数着你继续好的请尝试网站中的示例。在下周之前，我将通过那些下周的例子现在我们来看看输入阻抗。这是一件要讨论的老事情。我们已经描述了电压和电流方面的系统。我们已经描述了反式的性质。这是我的传输线系统。它和以前的完全一样，有一个发电机。我有我的传输线。我有一大堆这些。我做了一些运输。它是斯莱恩α等于零。那么我的复数传播常数就是对于复数值，jβ我对这些的表达。我说，在这种情况下，减少到，如图所示我我已经离开了超过变量暂时在那里。作为由下面赋予入射路径的相位，以便产生反射波同样，与其他方面一样，我不要求您完成推导过程。它在这里，所以它在哪里我们所做的是推导出一个可以表示系统输入阻抗的表达式。我很想知道。发电机看到了什么？我有发电机。我有法律的传输线。我把发电机连接到传输线的这一端。它看起来是什么阻抗？它能看到负载阻抗吗它能看到线路的特性阻抗吗？它看到别的东西了吗？这就是我们现在要生成的表达式。

I've got my voltage in current input impedance. It looks like a real impedancelike is that it's the total voltage divided by the total currentOn the bottom there, I'm expressing the currents in terms of the voltage and characteristic impedance of lifeThat is just, again, some allergy for manipulation So how do you relateI've taken outsorry, I need to.as I go from the point of that Represents the reflection ApolloIt has a sizeIt potentially has a phase angle caused by the load itselfThis is the full world. Incidentally,  this divided by this is the low reflection coefficient There is a voltage reflection coefficient. Know the V is already disappeared and calling it gamma LThe reflection coefficient at the mode in terms of voltageWe take the my expression, then we simplify it further, though. This will not look like I've simplified it to youWe substitute in for gamma L in terms of the impedance is, and we use Euler toilet to the

我在电流中得到了我的电压输入阻抗。它看起来像一个真正的阻抗。就像是那样它是总电压除以总电流在底部，我用电压和生命的特征阻抗来表示电流。再一次，这只是对操纵的一些过敏。那你是怎么联系的？我已经拿出来了对不起，我需要。我从这一点出发表示反射阿波罗它有尺寸。它可能具有由负载本身引起的相位角这是一个完整的世界。顺便说一句，这个除以这个就是低反射系数存在电压反射系数。我知道V已经消失了，并称它为伽玛L以电压表示的模式反射系数我们拿着我的表达式，然后我们进一步简化它。对你来说，这看起来不像是我简化了它。我们用阻抗Is代替伽玛L，并使用欧拉厕所到

Don't know what you prefer. What do you mean That we use you as identity We end up with this. This is my simplified expressionDoesn't look much simplifiedIf we divide through here by code and the cosine term, we end up with something that this is where we stop. Go to the lakeWe end up with something that describes the input impedancea note. And the apologies. I forgot to highlight this when looking at the location minus L,  who saysat the beginning was substituted for minus LAll right That at this.remember, my load is located at 7040 by generator where I want to find the impedance. Is it Z equals minus LSo throughout that derivationyou can from here, I'm substituted in, but then people minus L just be clear about thatWhat does this tell us about the impedance at the inputWhat is it dependent onIt's dependent on more things than you might have thoughtIt depends on the load impedance attached to the end of the transmission line number.

不知道你喜欢什么。你是什么意思我们用你作为身份。我们最终得到了这个。这是我的简化表达。看起来并没有简化多少如果我们在这里除以代码和余弦项，我们最终会得到一些东西，这是我们停止的地方去湖边。我们最终得到了描述输入阻抗的东西。一张纸条。还有道歉。我在看位置减去L的时候忘了强调这一点，谁说的？一开始是用负L代替的。好吧在这个。记住，我的负载位于7040通过发电机，我想找到阻抗。是Z等于负l吗？所以在整个推导过程中你可以从这里，把我替换进去，然后再把人减去我。就这样清楚这一点这告诉我们什么？关于输入端的阻抗它依赖于什么它所依赖的东西比你想象的要多。它取决于连接到传输线号末端的负载阻抗。

I have my generator, my transmission line my look the impedance, I see at the input to the transmission line, this expression tells me is dependent on the load of teamsIt's dependent on the characteristic impedance of the line that zeroIt's dependent on how long the line isAlice is that can be the L Since beta is also in that, it's also dependent on the wavelength of the source the source itself the frequency is functioning out for the wavelength that's functioning out has an impact on the impedance scene looking into the transmission line Very strange concept from the sand. What are we saying From the standpoint of the generator, this is the systemLet's just pretend you are the generatorYou are throwing energy into the transmission lineIf I took thatcalculated the values in it and replace the transmission line and the load impedance with a lumped elements that had the exact values that he you is the generator would not know there was any change to the system

我有我的发电机，我的传输线我的表情我在传输线的输入端看到的阻抗，这个表达式告诉我，它取决于组的负载。它取决于零线的特性阻抗。这取决于队伍有多长。爱丽丝就是那个可以是L因为β也在其中，所以它也取决于光源的波长。源本身频率对起作用的波长起作用。对阻抗场景有影响调查传输线非常奇怪的概念从沙子里。我们在说什么？从发电机的角度来看，这是系统让我们假装你是发电机你正在向传输线注入能量。如果我拿了那个。计算了其中的值并用集总元件代替传输线和负载阻抗有确切的价值，他你是发电机，不会知道系统有任何变化。

It would look exactly the same to you. Byebye This is an equivalent impedance to what the transmission line with the load attached at the frequency looks like it's the equivalent of peoplesI'm not saying that's what we've doneThing. That's what we could do It would look the same to the generator, would not see this systemAnd that systemthere's any differenceThat's a little confusingLet's look at a couple of special casesBut this may look even more confusing to youThat's all the first special case. If I make the loan open circuit said L is equal to infinity I substitute infinity into thatThat expression at the Top of them, what I get is an expression in terms of the cold tangenta bit of that. What's up me It tells me that as I change saidin negative% I remember my load is at Z equals zero. I'm moving towards the generatorthe-%

在你看来完全一样。拜拜这是连接负载的传输线的等效阻抗在频率上看起来它相当于人我不是说这就是我们所做的东西。这就是我们能做的。发电机看起来是一样的，不会看到这个系统。和系统有什么区别吗这有点令人困惑。让我们来看几个特例。但这可能会让你更加困惑。这都是第一种特殊情况。如果我让贷款开路所说的L等于无穷大我把无限代入其中。上面的那个表情，我得到的是用冷切线表示的表达式有点那个。我怎么了它告诉我，正如我改变所说的在负%中我记得我的负载是Z等于零。我正朝发电机走去该-%

The same changes negatively the impedance I see looking in will changeWhat's really confusing is that it's N equals zeroThe co tangent function is infinity That's good, because we just said the load is an open circuit. It is infinityBut if I move a distancethat means bitter time said, is equal to pi over two That will happen when Z equals lambda over fourthen the cotangent function becomes zeroAnd my input impedance looks like a short circuit Despite the fact that I have a transmission line that has an open circuit attached to the end of itUnder some circumstancessome distance from here looking into the transmission line will look like an open circuit Is that exciting? Mind blownVery strangeWhat we're saying is a transmission like a piece of cable can transform an impedance from looking like an open circuit to looking like a short circuitIf I took this transmission line made of 1/4 wavelength longleft the end open circuit and attached it to my signal generator.

同样的变化是消极的我看到的阻抗会改变真正令人困惑的是是n等于零余正切函数为无穷大这很好，因为我们刚才说负载是开路。它是无限的但如果我移动一段距离意思是苦的时候说，等于圆周率除以二。这将发生在Z等于λ除以4的时候。则余切函数变为零和我的输入阻抗看起来像短路。尽管事实如此我有一条传输线。它的末端有一个开路。在某些情况下离这里有一段距离，看着输电线。看起来像是开路。很刺激吗？头脑爆炸非常奇怪我们所说的传输就像一根电缆。可以变换阻抗从看起来像开路到看起来像短路如果我拿了该传输线由1/4波长制成左端开路把它连接到我的信号发生器上。

I'm effectively taking the signal generator and making it a short circuitThat is clearly not a good ideaWhy would you want to take a signal generator and just short circuit the output is what this allows you toLet's look at the oppositeWhat happens if I make settle the load of peoplesA short circuit, I said he said L equals zero My function at the Top there, my expression at the Top reduces to a tangent What does that mean? And said equals zeroThe time function times 00Okay,  that's good. That is what I have attackedIt means looks like short circuitbut just like the cotangentif I move 1/4 wavelength down the transmission line I look at what is now happening to the input impedance of the lightIt's become an open circuit. It looks infinite A simple piece of coaxial cablesimple piece of transmission line come provide an impedance transport the quarter wavelengths here is a specific example of this.

我把信号发生器短路了这显然不是个好主意。你为什么要拿一个信号发生器来短路输出呢？这就是它能让你让我们看看相反的情况。如果我让人安定下来会怎么样短路，我说他说L等于零我的函数在顶部，我的表达式在顶部简化为切线。这是什么意思？并且所说的等于零时间函数乘以00好的，很好。这就是我所攻击的。意思是看起来像短路。但就像余切一样如果我沿着传输线移动1/4波长我看看现在光的输入阻抗发生了什么变化。它变成了一个开路。它看起来是无限的一根简单的同轴电缆简单传输线来提供阻抗传送这里的四分之一波长是这方面的一个具体例子。

We will come back to probably a week nine, maybe the quarter wavelength transformer, and we will use it for somethingWhat I'm showing you here, specifically is by looking at what the input impedance of a transmission line looks likeis dependent on the length of the line and the frequency of the signal on the line. This is telling another example for you to do in your own timeHow long we've got 20 minutes that's up thereSo we will finish today's content. And next week we will go through the all of the examples from this point That means we've seen an entire week. That's good Now we developed earlier an expression for the reflection coefficientSpecifically, the low reflection talking We know we can calculate the low reflection coefficients in terms of impedance of the whole impedance of the transmission line

我们可能会在第九周回来。四分之一波长变压器，我们会用它来做一些事情。我在这里向你们展示的是，通过观察传输线的输入阻抗是什么样子的。取决于线路的长度和线路上信号的频率这很说明问题另一个例子是你在自己的时间里做的。我们还有20分钟，就在上面所以我们将完成今天的内容。下周我们将从这一点开始讨论所有的例子。这意味着我们已经看到了整整一周那很好现在我们开发得更早。反射系数的表达式具体来说，低反射谈话我们知道我们可以计算低反射系数。就整体阻抗而言传输线阻抗

Now we're going to develop an expression that generalize thisThe idea of the reflection coefficientI like some diffusion We know that at the input to the linethe input impedance of minus L was expressedas is shown that we have that expert in the middle of that over moving from minus L to any minus X,  effectively, substituting L everywhere by zeroand simplifying the sex preference lightly for that. All we've doneit's takenThey spent out as common and it disappearedWhat we end up with is an expression describing input impedance, and what I will call a generalized term for selection coefficientI'm defining reflection coefficient at any., sayOr what does that meanWe just saw an example when I took the system, I calculated the input impedance, how the input to the transmission line Then I change the system, I took away the transmission line, and I put a long element there with the same value would set in.

现在我们要开发一个表达式来推广这个。反射系数的概念我喜欢一些扩散我们知道在线路的输入端负L的输入阻抗为表达的正如所显示的那样，我们有专家在中间。从.移动负l到任何负X，有效地，将l处处替换为零并为此简化了性别偏好。我们所做的一切它被拿走了他们把钱花得很普通，然后就消失了。我们最终得到的是描述输入阻抗的表达式，我称之为广义项。对于选择系数我定义的反射系数是任意的。或者这意味着什么？我们刚刚看到了一个例子。当的时候我拿着这个系统，我计算了输入阻抗，如何将输入传输到传输线上。然后我改变了系统，我把传输线拿走了，我在那里放了一个很长的元件。将设置相同的值。

I said this is the same system for the generator If I can do thatthen I could calculate the reflection coefficient for that input impedance this is just a theoretical toolIf I can calculate input impedance, looking into the transmission line at any positionthen that input impedance will have an associated reflection coefficientDescribe that a bit further. Make sure you understand This expression is what I'm describing as a generalized reflecting bookReflection coefficient at any., say I can write it in terms of that reflection talkingWhat does it representIt tells us at any.along the transmission linethe ratio of reflected voltage to forward voltageThe same as it was a little bit We define the rigidly the reflection coefficient as the reflected voltage and below divided by the incident voltage at the lowThis is just generalizing that to any position

我说这是发电机的相同系统。如果我能做到的话。然后我可以计算反射系数对于该输入阻抗这只是一个理论工具。如果我能计算输入阻抗，在任何位置观察传输线。然后那个输入阻抗将具有相关的反射系数再进一步描述一下。确保你明白。这个表达就是我所描述的一本广义的反思书。任意位置的反射系数，例如我可以把它写成反思谈话。它代表什么？它告诉我们在任何.沿着传输线。反射电压与正向电压之比就像它有一点我们将反射系数严格地定义为反射电压及以下除以低处的入射电压这只是把它推广到任何位置。

Any point, I take the reflected voltage value, I take the incident voltage value, I divide the two, it gives me a reflection for thingsHow does it change with distance when it contains the propagation constantGamma, little gamma What will have some real part Imaginary part, in factlet's have a look at thatEasiest way to have a look at this is to separate out the real part of the imaginary part gamma L in this has a magnitude It has an anglethe exponential term have the magnitude part with the Alpha in it. And it has an angle part. Read it, isn't it We're going to treat those two things separately. We're going to look at how magnitude changes for reflection coefficientand how angle changes for election court.  We're back hereHere is my, but we're going to put the forward the magnitude of the forward and reflected voltages relative to each otherWe know it said equals zeroThe magnitude of my forward voltage is just be 0 plus what we define it as

任何一点，我取反射电压值，我取入射电压值，我将两者相除，它给出了事物的反射。当它包含传播常数时，它是如何随距离变化的伽玛小伽玛什么会有一些真正的部分？事实上是虚部。让我们看看那个最简单的方法来看看这个。就是分离出来。虚部的实部伽玛L在这个有一个量级它有一个角度。指数项有带α的大小部分。且其具有角形部分，读它，不是吗？我们将分别对待这两件事。我们来看看震级是如何变化的。对于反射系数以及选举法庭的角度如何变化我们回到这里这是我的，但我们将提出正向和反射电压相对于彼此的幅度我们知道它等于零。我的正向电压的大小只是0加我们把它定义为

That's just the size of my incident way at the loadedour end is the loading that equals zeroIf I was to trace that back to the input of the transmission line, it must get bigger If the line is lossyI put something in at this endThis is the input in it has an exponential decade, and we define the at the moment Or this was the value of the size of the incident voltage We can write that as thatIt has increased by that exponential. So rather than decrease financialbecause we're starting in the output, we're moving to the input, the incident wave must be bigger than the inputThe reflected way is that incident wave multiplied by the size of the reflection coefficient,  the size of the reflected wave is just gamma L of the magnitude of gamma L multiplied by V non plus Then if I want to see what the reflected wave looks like in the input it's going to have an exponential decay.

这就是我的事故的规模在装货时我们的终端是等于零的负载。如果我要追溯到传输线的输入，它必须变得更大。如果线路有损耗我在这头放了点东西。这是中的输入它有一个指数十年，我们定义了此刻或者这是入射电压大小的值我们可以这样写它以指数增长。因此，与其减少财务因为我们从输出端开始，我们移动到输入端，入射波必须比输入端大。反射的方式是入射波乘以反射系数的大小，即反射波的大小就是伽玛L的大小乘以V非正然后，如果我想看到输入中的反射波是什么样子的它将呈指数衰减。

It doesn't get bigger as a way of troubles. It gets smaller Let's go right back to the beginning in terms of magnitudeI start off with an input to my transmission line here of thisAs it propagate along the transmission line, I lose this thingThe magnitude of the incident photons, the magnitude of the inputis this at the end of the trafficIt is then reflected by the law to multiply by the magnitude of gamma L, gamma L is constrained by a maximum magnitude of formIt is a value between zero and four Is smaller than this AIt could be the same size, typically smallMy reflected wave enters the transmission line againand propagate them to the input They get smaller as a propagator must get smaller The actual magnitude, if I reflected wave as to professors of the transmission line and has to expansion of the days

它不会变大作为一种麻烦的方式。它变小了让我们右后卫从头开始就规模而言我从这个传输线的输入开始。当它沿着传输线传播时，我失去了这个东西。入射光子的大小，输入的大小这是在交通的尽头吗然后由定律反映为乘以γL的大小，γL受形式的最大幅度的约束它是一个介于0和4之间的值比这个小。A, 它可以是相同的大小，通常是小的我的反射波再次进入传输线并将它们传播到输入它们变小，因为传播子必须变小。实际幅度，如果我反射波至于教授的输电线路，已经扩展到了天。

It has the gamma L two That's exactly what we have I will generalize reflection coefficient expressionThose terms govern the magnitude of the reflected way I know this is the voltage of the input, this multiplied by that. What's the baseThat's what the reflection coefficient is telling you, rightIt is the ratio of reflected voltage to incidental. If I know the incident voltage somewheremultiplying it by the reflection coefficient tells me the reflected voltage at that point at the same.generalized that termWe can say the same thingBut the phase partagain, F up below, then we defined the incident voltage is not having any face timeIf I move that back to the inputthey're not going through one lot of thingsI have a multiplication by the low reflection coefficient, which may or may not change the things of the incidentally I have a reflected wave which also travels back of the transmission of people Again, my generalized term for reflection coefficient is describing how the angle of the input wave changes by propagating of the transmission line being reflected by the low and then traveling back from the transmission line

它有伽玛L二这正是我们所拥有的。我将推广反射系数表达式。那些条款控制反射方式的大小我知道这是输入的电压，这个乘以那个。基地是什么？这就是反射系数告诉你的，对吗？它是反射电压与偶然电压之比。如果我知道某个地方的入射电压乘以反射系数告诉我在同一点的反射电压。概括了那个术语我们可以说同样的话。但是相位部分又F, 那就在下面我们定义的入射电压是没有任何面对时间的如果我把它移回输入他们没有经历很多事情。我有一个低反射系数的乘法，这可能会也可能不会改变顺便说一句我有一个反射波，它也从人们的传输中传播回来。同样，我对反射系数的广义术语正在描述输入波的角度如何随传输线的传播而变化被损失所反映然后从传输线返回

It is traversed the transmission line twice It's 2 times the things like the translation of It includes any things caused by the local reflection of that's quite a lot to take a lookIt is described here. I'm not going to read that, but that is a description of exactly what I just saidIf you want to read it yourself like Finally, there is a final example We have done a lot this morning, really? We done a lotI'm pleased we've gotten through what we got through today because that kind of gets rid of everything you've done before, the repeated things you should have seen. We've developed all of the basic concepts that we need to do the rest of the semester From next week, we will start really looking at application of digital

它穿过输电线路两次这是两倍的东西，比如翻译它包括由局部反射引起的任何事情。要看的东西太多了。在此对其进行描述。我不打算读它，但这正是我刚才所说的描述。如果你想自己读的话最后，还有最后一个例子。今天早上我们做了很多事，真的吗？我们做了很多。我很高兴我们度过了今天所经历的一切，因为这是一种摆脱你以前做过的每一件事，你应该看到的重复的事情。我们已经开发了我们需要的所有基本概念。做完这学期剩下的事。从下周开始，我们将开始真正关注数字的应用。
