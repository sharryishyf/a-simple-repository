Actually, so where we are using the sensors, it's also important that we can process the signals because the signals we collect directly from the sensors, they are a very we call them raw data.  It's the combine some voice and also comprise some disturbance. So this cannot be directly used to our control, to our display.  So that is unacceptable because you will see many, 000 So the thing that we should do is to we should have a signal conditioning, can openly call signal processing That is to assess what we call 30 conditional. The signals collected from the sensors such as this is easy for display, easy for feedback control, and also maybe easy one for to correct the other sentence, because this is the signal conditioning just one thing is that the data directly from the sensors could not be used as we should process it

实际上，在我们使用传感器的地方，我们能够处理信号也很重要，因为我们收集的信号直接从传感器，他们是一个非常我们称之为原始数据。这是结合一些声音且还包括一些干扰。所以这个不能直接用于我们的控制，我们的显示。那就是不可接受，因为你会看到很多000, 所以我们应该做的是就是我们要有一个信号调理，可以公开的叫信号处理。那就是评估我们所说的30个条件。从传感器收集的信号，例如这易于显示，易于反馈控制，也可能易于纠正另一个句子，因为这是信号调节只是一件事是，直接来自传感器的数据不能像我们应该处理的那样使用。

Here is a detailed analyze, I think the pressure of the signal conditioning is all possible signal from a sensors or measurement system, and generally to be processed, in some way, managed to a suitable for next stage of operation. So this means theas I have said, right data from the sensorsbecause they cannot be directly used, it must be processed such that can be used for the next stage. Okay Maybe you are too smallmaybe the signal are too small, how to be amplified. Sometimes the signals we collect is only like the0.001 books if you directly want to use it. So it's too small, has how to be amplified It may contain the experience to interferenceMeans that this is your collective signal is combined with other kinds of signals, this kind of make it kind of mixture Another one is a nonlinear and requires linearization. This is for our they are easy processing of the dataOr I don't know,  it is analog and have to be made digital.

这是一个详细分析后，我认为压力信号的调理是指所有可能来自传感器或测量系统的信号，并且一般要经过处理，以某种方式管理到一个合适的用于下一阶段的操作。所以这意味着正如我所说的，来自传感器的正确数据因为它们不能直接使用，所以必须进行处理这样可以用于下一阶段。好的也许你太小了。也许是信号太小，怎么会被放大。有时如果你想直接使用它，我们收集的信号就像0.001本书一样。所以它太小了，怎么会被放大呢？它可能包含对干扰的体验。意味着这是你的集体信号与其他类型的信号相结合，这使它成为一种混合物。另一个是非线性的，需要线性化。这是为了我们的它们很容易处理数据。或者我不知道，它是模拟的，必须数字化。

So this is for some digital control systemthere be a resistance change and have to be made into a voltage changeSo this is more something we have get in touch before, because when we are using like the strangers and like also the a temperature sensor, but usually the change is in resistanceBut what we need to do is to make it into a voltage change. But this is the reason why we always connect the sensors to an electric circuitLet's do because we want to transform the resistance change to a voltage change, and all this change can be referred to as the signal condition. So all these things, like we are amplified to make it larger, right? And we are we limit the same interference and also transform it to linear edition

这是一些数字控制系统。有一个电阻变化，并且必须转换成电压变化所以这是我们以前接触过的更多的东西，因为当我们像陌生人一样使用时，也像温度传感器，但通常变化在电阻上。但是我们要做的是把它变成一个电压的变化。但这就是为什么我们总是将传感器连接到电路的原因。让我们这样做，因为我们想要将电阻变化转换为电压变化，所有这些变化都可以称为信号条件。所以所有这些东西，就像我们被放大，使它变得更大，对吗？而我们是我们限制了相同的干扰，并将其转换为线性版本

All these are called a signal conditioning Here is a process of this signal position. Generally, it can be divided right throughout the three partsThe first one is this.  We input the thusthe information, right? So we put the veterans that make an example. Here is the temperature.  We send it to sensors The sensors will give out the signal related to the quantity, right?  It's maybe a potential difference into the temperatureAnd then some information has to be sent to an amplifierto make the make the output larger. But it also can be other types of the condition like it can are limiting experience and also maybe it can be linearize It's not just amplifier here. It can be some other process or you can use several parts together. You can use the amplifier, they use this event, eliminate the interference

所有这些都称为信号调节这是一个过程。信号位置。一般来说，它可以在三个部分之间进行正确的划分。第一个是这个。我们输入因此信息，对吧？所以我们把老兵以儆效尤。这是温度。我们把它发送到传感器。传感器会发出与数量相关的信号，对吗？这是也许是温度的电势差然后必须发送一些信息。到放大器使使输出更大。但是它也可以是其他类型的条件一样，它可以是有限经验，也可能是可以线性化的这里不只是放大器。它可以是一些其他的过程，或者你可以使用几个。零件在一起。你可以使用放大器，他们利用这个事件，消除干扰。

Right? Because all this can happen in this process you just how to put it to the display or to the controlAs this is the whole process of theat least from a system, also includes sensors and the data collision finally display.  This is in the middle, the threat of breach between the some of us could be what the final where you use them It is, what are you Like a breach of the legal system system conditioning elements and signal for the training involved protection to prevent damage to the next element in the systemLike it's getting a signal into a form require, because these are contents as we can also reduce some noise. Also, these are some functions of the signal conditioningSo commonly used elements is like the wisdom bridge production elements, filters, like the amplifiers and motivators.

对的？因为这一切都可能发生。在这个过程中你只是如何把它显示或控制。因为这是整个过程至少从一个系统来看，还包括传感器和数据的冲突最后显示这是在中间，威胁之间的缺口我们中的一些人可以在决赛中使用他们。是的，你是什么？比如违反法律制度。系统调节元件和信号对于培训所涉及的保护，以防止损坏系统中的下一个元件就像它把信号转换成所需的形式，因为这些内容我们也可以减少一些噪音。此外，这些是信号调理的一些功能所以常用的元素就像是智慧桥的制作元素，过滤器，就像是放大器和激励器。

So today we are going to I think we were involved like all these for the previous four. The wisdom bridge protection elements is this the filters and also the amplifiers The most important thing is these two is your the wisdom bridge. So this is what we analyzeAnd also the amplifiers. This is also we're going to look into detail as a production elements in the filters is true. And I want you to just have a brief understanding of these are true because of analyzing this will involves other contents,  the protection one, we will have a brief introduction and the filters is this. So you will get in touch with when you have learned the frequency command, which is there is next half of this this module

所以今天我们要我认为我们参与了前四个项目。智慧桥保护元件是滤波器和放大器。最重要的是这两个是你的智慧桥。所以这是我们分析的。还有放大器。这也是我们将要研究的细节，因为过滤器中的生产元素是真实的。我只想让你简短地对这些的理解是真实的，因为分析这份遗嘱涉及到其他内容，保护之一，我们将有一个简短的介绍和过滤器是这个。所以当你学会了频率命令，你就会接触到还有下一半。这个模块

First of all, let's look at this wisdom bridge. And so which is an important processing technique for the like for the temperature sensorsSo wisdom bridge it's in this form. It can be used to converge on resistant change to a voltage change. This is one part of function or one part of the example, as we mentioned in data processing, data condition and service, transforming a resistance change to a voltage change. Because the voltage change we can measure it, we can display it.  This is something we can use If you only have a resistance change, it's so difficult to take directly It can detect a very small change in the resistance the breach is in this shape, but so it has the input voltageIt means it needs to supply some energy.

首先，让我们来看看这座智慧桥。所以这是一种重要的加工技术比如温度传感器。所以智慧桥它是这种形式的。它可用于将电阻变化收敛到电压变化。正如我们所提到的，这是函数的一部分或示例的一部分。在数据处理、数据调节和服务中，将电阻变化转换为电压变化。因为电压变化我们可以测量它，我们可以显示它。这是我们可以用的东西。如果你只有一个阻力变化，那就很难直接服用它可以检测到电阻的微小变化缺口是这个形状的，但它有输入电压这意味着它需要供应一些能量。

You have the vs, which is input You have two arms.  We have thisFirst one is ABC with this arm. Second one is this ABC You have two arms You can see in hr, and there are two resistorsBut, for example, in the apc, you have to you have two resistors, are one, and actually but in the adc, so it also has a R three and R four. So there are the song in each arms are true with this resistors, and they will divide the voltage as the voltage in between what are what is the label and the B and C points? This was the difference between them is the output. It's just so this is the structure of this with some bridge generally. So I could see a few two arms are parallel, and hr have the two resistors to divide the voltage

你有VS，它是输入你有两只手臂。我们有这个第一个是这个手臂的ABC。第二个是ABC你有两只胳膊。你可以在HR中看到，有两个电阻但是，例如，在APC中，您必须你有两个电阻，是一个，实际上但在ADC中，它也有一个R 3和R 4。所以有对于这个电阻，每个臂中的歌曲都是真实的，并且它们将把电压划分为中间的电压什么是标签和B点和C点是什么？这是他们之间的区别是输出正是如此这是这个的结构一般用一些桥。所以我可以看到几个臂是平行的，HR有两个电阻来分压。

But as the thing is, the important thing for the breach is that the our parentsOkay, so if we say is a breach is balanced,  so it means this R one over R twothere is a ratio between the abcr,  the ratio between in the ABC arm, the to divide the voltage is equal equivalence is equal toThe second argument is that means, see you againIf it's balancedthe voltage level in B and C, because they are the sameBecause the output voltage for V zero,  we say it's equals to the voltage level at point B minus voltage level at point DNot so much intuitive. And so the vvvo, the output voltage equal to the difference between the voltage measure in point B and point D,  the voltage level at point B is just to analyze these are because it's our chance they are parallel.

但事实是，对于违约来说，重要的是我们的父母好的，那么如果我们说一个缺口是平衡的，那么它的意思是R1除以R2。在ABCR之间有一个比率，在ABC臂中，分压等于等于第二个论点是这意味着再次见到你如果它是平衡的B和C中的电压电平，因为它们是相同的因为输出电压为了V0，我们说它等于点B的电压电平点D的负电压电平没有那么直观。所以VVVO，输出电压等于点B和点D测量的电压之间的差值，点B的电压电平只是分析这些是因为这是我们的机会，他们是平行的。

We only need to analyze one arm for the B points.  It's a simple voltage dividing VB equals to vsThis is the first part of vs times part two is is this a resistor or two a device that determines the voltage level of one B?  ThisBecause it's only a true resistors. There are two R two is connected to the ground.  This is here is zero, and here is V two over R one plus R two times us.  This is the voltage level IB. So it provides the input voltage us The same applies for this adcr There are four is wrong here. R four It's device has to be enough for the divide in the us As we say, the R one over R two equals two R three or four.

对于B点，我们只需要分析一只手臂。这是一个简单的电压划分VB。等于VS这是VS时代的第一部分，第二部分是这是一个电阻还是两个决定一个B的电压电平的器件？这因为它只是一个真正的电阻有两个R2接地。这里是0，这里是V2/R1+R2/US。这是电压电平IB。所以它提供了输入电压US这同样适用于此ADCR有四个在这里是错的R四它的设备必须足以应对美国的分裂。正如我们所说，R1/R2等于2，R3或4。

That means the ratio between to do divide the voltage that they are the same We can the last thing we can just try to derive it here,  because R one over R two equals R three or R four, you can say we divide both like this one here. And so we say, are you over R one plus R two ok It will equals he did write posts with R two.  It's one over R one over or 2+1.  This is one partThe other part is while over R three over R four+1. Right?  The second one, so free are to a computer difference between the two, because we say R one over R two, this one equals two, R three or R fourRight? So that means this difference will be zeroThat means this we all also will be zero.  This is so the dividing the voltage.

这意味着做除法之间的比率它们相同的电压我们可以最后一件事，我们可以试着在这里推导它，因为R1/R2等于R3或R4，你可以说我们把两者都除了。像这里的这个。所以我们说你结束了吗R一加R二好的它将等于他确实用R2写了帖子。超过一分了R超出一分或者2+1。这是一部分。另一部分是而超过R三超过R四+1.对的？第二个，所以自由是两者之间的计算机差异，因为我们说R1除以R2，这个1等于2，R3或R4。对的？所以这意味着此差异将为零这意味着我们也都将是零。这就是电压的划分。

And so generallyit's because the bridge is balanced, also is the ratio between R one, R two, and R three, R four, because they are the same.  That means the divided voltage ok as the to be and 3 points to understand. But this is because they are balancedIf this one say, we say R two is a big change,  this one will not be balanced, and zero immediately be a difference. What do you think Between these 2 points, the BMDWhy don't one, first of all, balanced that is hopefully in the worldAnd the next we can try to analyze if there are some a bit of the the resistance change in this circuitbecause markets you haveFor example, we can see that actually to be a sense of with the resistance change. So it can be like they are strangers. So it's of a big deformation and then the resistance change.

所以一般来说这是因为电桥是平衡的，也是R1，R2和R3，R4之间的比率，因为它们是相同的。这意味着分压正常，因为要和3点理解。但是这是因为它们是平衡的。如果这一个说，我们说R2是一个很大的变化，这一个不会平衡，零马上就是一个差异。你怎么看在这两点之间，BMD为什么不首先平衡一下世界上最有希望的还有下一个我们可以试着分析一下是否有一些电阻变化在这个电路中因为你拥有的市场例如，我们可以看到实际上是一种随着电阻的变化。就像他们是陌生人一样。所以这是一个大的变形，然后电阻发生变化。

But now it also can be some some metals and due to the change of temperaturethe resistance also changed. That means R two is a sensor which can change its resistance due to the environment of the by force also will change the temperature change in the resistance from R two to R two plus,  there is a big change to the environment We change our attitude are two plus,  gives a change in vo to the vo plus wo. Again,  if we say this are trueis a bit changed, right? So this balance doesn't existDoes not hold anymore This time, the change in the vok to do thatThere will be R two plus. There are right, because this is changed Plus R one plus R two plus one minus. This is the same So there are we allif we are- is this vo here, and vo is bill is the original voltage that is this one.

但现在它也可以是一些一些金属和由于温度的变化阻力也发生了变化。这意味着R 2是一个可以改变的传感器它的电阻由于环境的受力也会改变温度。电阻从R2变为R2+，环境发生了很大的变化。我们改变我们的态度是两个加，把VO的变化变成VO加WO。同样，如果我们说这是真的是有点变了，对吧？所以这种平衡并不存在不再适用这一次，VOK的变化去做那件事会有R 2+。有权利，因为这是改变。加R一加R二加一减。这是一样的。所以我们都在那里如果我们是-这里是VO吗，VO是比尔是原始电压，也就是这个。

So it's avsStart to overall process through and also awful. As you ask for,  if we move the rr of V zero to the other side,  just to this term will cancel They are both the same The only thing remains is that this changing are 2 plus there areAnd over the setup is denominator and minus this original R two over R one plus R two.  This is if we move the V zero to the right hand sidebecause we can just try to compute this one,  because we have a assumption that the dollar is much smaller as you are too. This is also a somehow common to the resistance change sensors.

所以它是AVS通过和开始整个过程令人畏惧的。正如你所要求的，如果我们把V0的RR移到另一边，正好到这一项就会抵消。他们都是一样的。唯一剩下的就是这个改变是2加有在设置上是分母和负数原来的R2除以R1加上R2。这是如果我们搬家右手边的V零因为我们可以试着计算这个，因为我们有一个假设，美元比你小得多。这也是一种共同的电阻变化传感器。

The really, the change in the resistance will be much smaller than the original value If we say third R is much smalleryou are true. Right? So we can sayin denominator,  because we have R one plus R two plus there are it means as R one plus R twowill be a much greater than the data, will be much larger than the otherThat means this one can be neglected in the denominator It means if we can neglect this term here it will be R two plus rr one plus R two In both no matter It's threeI'll write it down, so it's our one. What about you? Or to us minus R one plus R R two ok in the up is the R two plusThere are minus R two versus wake up It's only remains the Delta R

实际上，电阻的变化将比原始值小得多如果我们说第三个R要小得多你是真的。对的？所以我们可以说在分母中，因为我们有R1+R2另外还有它的意思是R 1加R 2会比一个数据大得多，会比另一个大得多。这意味着这个可以在分母中被忽略。意思是如果我们在这里忽略这个术语它将是R2加RR1加R2在两个方面都无所谓是三个我会把它写下来，所以它是我们的你呢或者对我们减去R 1加上R R 2，在上面是R 2加上有负R两个对醒来吧它只剩下ΔR

This means that's the it will give us this relation here. There's a Delta R over R one plus R two Once again,  if we 23, together on the third are, will be a much more smaller than R one plus R two This can be directed. There is easy to make the difference between these two not only do not exist This is a very good approximation. All we can say is a very good linear relation.  We are the change in the voltageIt's not a linear with respect to the Gerard We sit here with this approximation, changing the output voltage is proportional or is linear to the change in the resistance of the sensors. There is no because here is no load resistance across the output

这意味着这是它会在这里给我们这个关系。在R1+R2上有一个ΔR再一次，如果我们23合起来在第三个是，将是一个比R1加R2小得多的这是可以指导的。很容易使这两者之间的差别不仅不存在。这是一个非常好的近似值。我们只能说这是一个非常好的线性关系。我们是电压的变化相对于杰勒德，它不是线性的在这种近似情况下，输出电压的变化与传感器的电阻变化成正比或线性关系。没有，因为这里没有负荷输出端电阻

We assume that this is just has there, right? We don't connect anything to the outputs. And if there is such a resistance, then it's called a loading effect has to be considered because there will be some change to V zero. But anyway, because this is just a lower resistanceit's something we add. We can also always eliminate such change. So this is so here we always consider this no load resistance case. So we just always assume no load connected It's just a computer, the output voltage here This one,  I think here is something very good.  It's gonna be 00. The output equals is linear to the that are this is the first analysis to the wisdom bridge. So the thing that all the main take out is that the after this competition, right?

我们假设这是只是有那里，对不对？我们没有将任何东西连接到输出。如果有这样的阻力，那么它被称为负载效应，必须加以考虑，因为会有一些变化到V零。但无论如何，因为这只是一个较低的电阻这是我们添加的东西。我们也总是可以消除这样的变化。那么所以在这里我们总是认为这是没有负载的。电阻箱。所以我们只是始终假设未连接负载这只是一台电脑，这里的输出电压这个，我觉得很不错。要到00了。输出等于与那是这是对智慧桥的第一个分析。所以所有主要的事情都是在这次比赛之后，对吗？

The out of the change in the voltage will be a linear proportional to the change in the resistorYou're going to try to compute them like the if it's not R two change, if it's R one change or R 3014, any of them, any of these are four.  Just if one of them change the output, we always cannot be linear with respect to the change of the resistancePeople are so such religion always holds Another issue is this bridge financing balancing is very importantChildren are usually swung is better to be calibrated before we use them. Otherwise, there will be a constant error in this system They sure about this,  which balancing is that a breach is in stock is very unlikely as a bridge will output exactly zeros of threesBecause we cannot guarantee that is balanced. Boss is a manufacturer Always is that the slight variance in the resistance among which are these two are some non zero initial standard value

电压的变化将与电阻器的变化成线性比例你要试着计算它们，就像如果不是R两个变化，如果是R一个变化或R 3014，它们中的任何一个，它们中的任何一个都是四个。只要他们中的一个改变了输出，我们总是相对于电阻的变化不可能是线性的人们是这样的，这样的宗教总是成立的。另一个问题是，这种过桥融资的平衡非常重要。孩子们通常是摇摆的，最好在我们使用他们之前进行校准。否则，在这个系统中将存在恒定的误差他们确信这一点，这是一种平衡，即库存中的缺口是非常不可能的，因为网桥将输出三个零。因为我们不能保证这是平衡的。老板是个制造商。总是电阻的微小变化，其中这两个是一些非零的初始标准值

Here we say, is that the there is some small change in the resistance It's not exactly as we want as balanced. Okay. So generally, we want R one over R two and O equals R three over. Thank youFor some time, but is always that the maybe there are some this is emphasizeThis is also improvise and think of us to the rt and R four. So there are some difference between all these for resistance. And then we need to make them right. And so we need to get the it balanced and that you do this a few ways.  And to can handle this initial setThe first one is that,  I think is the simplest is use the software to compensateBut so you can compensate for the because if we have a little offset on it, it is a fixed to the system that is due to the settings of the resistance.

在这里我们说，那是电阻有一些小的变化它并不完全像我们想要的那样平衡。好的。那么一般来说，我们希望R1除以R2，O等于R3除以谢谢有一段时间了，但总是那个也许有一些这是强调这也是我们对RT和R四的即兴发挥和思考。所以所有这些之间都有一些区别。为了抵抗。然后我们需要纠正他们。所以我们需要让IT保持平衡你有几种方法可以做到这一点。和到可以处理这个初始设置第一个是，我认为最简单的是用软件来补偿。但是你可以补偿，因为如果我们在它上面有一点偏移，它对系统是固定的。由于电阻的设置。

And it's a fixed error.  So we can use software to compensate for the initial voltageIf the opposite side is large enoughthe limits amplifier, again, can be applied to the output voltage limiting the dynamic range.  This means is if the initial error is too large, because it can make the system feel that you cannot workNormally, that's what we sayThis is software conversation. So we just give a virtual conversation between the initial voltageThe second one is the offset allowing a circuit. So we can use a adjustable resistance For example,  if one of them is not working correctly,  we can have a adjustable resistance potential meterbut you're physically adjust the output of the bridge to zero

这是一个固定的错误。所以我们可以用补偿初始电压的软件如果对面足够大限幅放大器同样可以应用于输出电压，从而限制动态范围。这意味着如果初始误差太大，因为它会让系统觉得你无法工作。通常，我们是这么说的。这是软件对话。所以我们只是在初始电压之间给出一个虚拟的对话。第二个是允许电路的偏移。所以我们可以使用可调电阻例如，如果其中一个不能正常工作，我们可以使用可调电阻电位计。但是你要把电桥的输出调整到零。

This is also a very good case, for example, is to advance for the as you can see here, we have introduced one more device,  write the potential meter This is making the system more complexAnother time you also need to manually calibrate the system so that the third one is this password of technology. So it's getting a knowledge circuitI did you adjust the DC voltage to the output is a as far asBut this is something we need to do with these three Here is an example let's just try to consider.  Here is thefor example, we have a wisdom bridge.  You really have a pretty and resistant temperature sensor. Is this is a temperature sensor that can change its resistance with respect to the temperature

这也是一个很好的例子，例如，是提前为正如你所看到的，我们有介绍的再来一个设备，写下电位计。这使得系统更加复杂。另一次，您还需要手动校准系统所以第三个就是这个科技的密码。所以它得到了一个知识回路。你把直流电压调到输出为远至但这是我们需要对这三个人做的事情。这里有一个例子，让我们试着考虑一下。这是比如说我们有一个智慧桥。你真的有一个漂亮的耐温传感器。是这是可根据温度改变其电阻的温度传感器

It's a podium, can remember a podium sensor.  It's strictly linear assessors change with the temperatureThey had a resistance at the0~1, at zero of 101 and forms for a moment with temperature and supply voltage six the breach is balanced at this temperatureHe serves the arm also have is the 100 on. That's what we said. All the resistance across is for a resistor is 100 on If the temperature coefficient is this one,  this is the podium is very straight and linear What will be the output voltage per degree change of the temperatureIf the load across the output can be assumed to be a weakness Here we have just a really long description, but don't be scared. So we can look into detail, right? So we have the resistance at zero degree of sensors is 100 on the supply voltage.

这是一个讲台，可以记住一个讲台。传感器。它是严格的线性评估者。随温度变化它们在0~1之间有电阻，在0处的电阻为101，并形成在温度和电源电压为6的情况下裂口在此温度下保持平衡。他发球的手臂也有。是100号。我们是这么说的。电阻两端的所有电阻为100导通如果温度系数是这个，这是讲台很直，很有线条。温度每变化一度，输出电压是多少？如果输出上的负载可以被认为是一个弱点这里我们有一个很长的描述，但不要害怕。所以我们可以调查细节，对吧？所以我们有在电源电压下，传感器零度时的电阻为100。

This is we ask, right Hi. So alarm also be one of them. So it means all these resistors have been startedwho is100 or so, meaning that this bridge is balanced. Okay If the temperature change is 0.0039, what will be the outputs? Which is per degree. Question, we say, is per degree. We don't specify the temperature of the first thing is that to solve this one that we need to recall the real change of the protein with respect to temperature,  resistance This is some relation we have give it before, we have told you before It's R zero plus Alpha TOther times, this is a linear restrictive, a strictly linear division If we want to investigate, right? How much Here we say is the change per degree. Right? So we need to investigate how much resistance changed per degree.

这是我们问，对嗨。所以警报也是其中之一。所以意思是所有这些电阻都已启动谁是100左右，意味着这座桥是平衡的。好的如果温度变化是0.0039，输出是什么也就是每度。我们说，问题是每一度。我们不指定温度第一件事是，为了解决这个问题，我们需要回忆起蛋白质的真正变化。到温度，电阻这是我们以前给它的一些关系，我们以前告诉过你。它是R零加上αT其他时候，这是一个线性限制，一个严格线性分开如果我们想调查，对吧？多少钱这里我们说的是变化。每度。对的？所以我们需要调查阻力有多大。每度变化。

So this is a derivative.  This is also a feasible meaning of a derivative because of it's true or get a derivative of rtWith respect to the temperature.  It's R zero AlphaMeans the change is change with respect to the change of the resistance, with respect to the temperature insideThis rt is at 0.039,  because this is, for example, we assume R twoOur tools are now the platinum sensor We say that the change of the resistance per degree is the 0.03900 K corresponds to the during the V zero,  it's the out of the changeWhat was the output voltage we can useThis equation here,  we can get now 0.010 voltage per degree There are Okay,  so this is actually there are change per degree is the 6 points0 times are 0 points are zeros from now.

所以这是衍生物。这也是一个导数的可行意义，因为这是真的，或者得到RT的导数关于温度。它是R零α意味着变化是相对于电阻的变化，相对于内部温度的变化这个RT是0.039，因为这是，例如，我们假设R2我们现在的工具是白金传感器。我们说每度电阻的变化是0.03900K对应于在V零期间，它是变化的输出我们可以使用的输出电压是多少这个方程，我们可以得到现在每度0.010电压有的好的，这实际上是每度的变化是6个点。0次从现在开始0分是零吗？

It is 0.039 This example,  the thing that might be a bit confusingis the single computer is called the per degree organizer is output voltage per degree. You can just take it as like you assume it's only changes for11°, 1°of the temperature. And then you can check how much voltage is changed This is a simple application of simple examination of this theory, of wisdom, which just one thing to be clear is that the structure is based on the voltage divider we have tosince we have to resistor,  devicethe input voltage in the two parts,  if the is well balancedthe ritual between our and want to North Korea know are for the same output will be zero.

它是0.039, 在这个例子中，这件事可能有点令人困惑是单台计算机，称为每度组织者，是输出电压每度。你可以把它当作你假设它只是变化对于11°，1°的温度。然后你就可以检查电压变化的程度这是一个简单的应用简单的检查这个理论，智慧，只有一件事要弄清楚的是，结构是基于分压器我们必须因为我们有电阻，设备两部分的输入电压（如果平衡良好）我们和想要之间的仪式朝鲜知道，同样的产量将为零。

And once there is any change in the resistor of the actual, so it will be some corresponding change in the voltage. And so the change is linear as we demand this is a theory of wisdom bridge until they areIt's very detailed applicationbut a very detailed applications like they arelike the temperature conversation, like this strangled detection.  Here.  Let's see some potential applications of these strangers. OkayThere are we can recall like a strange watch. So the sensory is to measure a very small strength major problem is that the Georgia resistance change not only with strength, but also with temperature Because they are all metals,  all the semiconductor The resistance change not only with the strengthbut also with the temperature this case is especially important for the semiconductor. So it has a much larger sensitivity to the temperature

一旦有任何变化。在实际的电阻中，所以会有一些电压的相应变化。所以变化是线性的如我们所要求的这是一个智慧桥的理论。直到他们是这是非常详细的应用。但是一个非常详细的应用程序，就像他们一样喜欢温度的对话，喜欢这种被扼杀的检测。这里。让我们看看一些这些陌生人的潜在应用。好的有的我们可以像一块奇怪的手表一样回忆。所以感官是测量一个非常小的强度，主要问题是格鲁吉亚的阻力不仅随着强度变化，还随着温度变化。因为它们都是金属，都是半导体阻力变化不仅与强度有关，而且还与温度有关。这种情况对于半导体尤其重要。所以它有一个对温度的敏感性大得多

Here,  what we want to do is that we want to eliminate the temperatureinformation, temperature, influenceIn this resistance, we say it didn't influence our measurement in the strength Here is aYeah, I hope you remember the definition of the strength. OkayThe change in the resistance over the original resistance with this 53 is ag is a constant temperature and how we can do the temperature conversation for the strangers.  This is to introduce the 2 piece of the strain gorge,  one into the same material The thing is to use a dummy strangers. And so this is, as we can say, see, there are 2 pieces of strain court, right The first one is thiswhich is in the same direction to the for supply as we push it.

在这里，我们想要做的是我们想要消除温度信息，温度，影响力在这个电阻中，我们说它没有影响我们在强度上的测量这是一个是的，我希望你还记得它的定义力量的。好的电阻相对于原始电阻的变化53是Ag是常数温度以及我们如何为陌生人进行温度对话。这是为了介绍这两块的应变峡，一块变成同样的材料。关键是要用一个假人。陌生人。所以这是，正如我们所说的，看，有两块应变球场，对吗？第一个是这个。它与的方向相同在我们推动它的时候供应。

So this this one will be placed in the same direction.  This is active. So it can sense the change,  so it will be longer with the extension Another one is called diamond is in the medical direction with respect to the force like the force is applied. And so it's like the pulling up and down the rg two, which is this one It's in the same direction, right? So it will also be pushed poorlike it will also extend, okay This is the active one because it will sense the change,  the sort of strength, the changing of a formBut for this one rg one it's coming.  It's in the perpendicular direction, as we see in this direction If we want toif we took a sense of strength, it must be in this direction.

所以这个这一个将被放置在相同的方向。这是主动的。所以它能感知。变化，所以它会随着延长而变长。另外一个叫钻石是医学方向的。关于部队就像施加的力一样。这就像上下拉动一样RG二号，也就是这个在同一个方向，对吗？所以它也会被推穷。就像它也会延伸，好吗？这是主动的，因为它会感觉到变化，那种力量，一种形式的变化。但对于这一个RG一个它来了。它在垂直方向上，正如我们在这个方向上看到的。如果我们想如果我们有力量的感觉，那一定是。在这个方向。

But now we don'tWe are our force is applied in the clinical direction.  This means that this one cannot sense the strength. And so this is the reason is called dummy, because is not really working as a strengthas a struggleOkay, so the word strength because also the word down here,  so dummy, it means that it's fake or it's not working as we want. So it's using something for other purpose.  It's the architecture here we call is active. Rg one is diamond.  This two placed in the particular configuration Time is strange. Work is identical to the one under strength, right? That is the active approach on this market, on the same material, but it's not subject to the strengthThis is, as we say, so rg to the active one can sense the strength, but this one cannot, but because they are placed in the same material as a temperature on both of them is the same.

但现在我们没有了我们是我们的力量被应用在临床方向。这意味着这个人感觉不到力量。所以这是原因是所谓的哑巴，因为它不是真正的力量。作为一种斗争好的，所以“力量”这个词，因为这里也有这个词，所以“傻瓜”，它的意思是它是假的或者它不起作用。如我们所愿。所以它把某些东西用于其他目的。这是我们在这里称之为主动的架构。RG One是钻石。这两个放在特定配置时间很奇怪。工作和力量下的工作是一样的，对吗？那是在这个市场上的积极做法，在同样的材料上，但它不受强度的影响。正如我们所说，这就是RG对活跃的人来说可以感觉到的的力量，但这一个不能，而是因为他们被放置在相同的材料。作为温度他们两个都是一样的。

So it means that these two can both sense the temperature, but only rg two. The active one can sense the strength As we think your time is transverse position to closeclose to the active port. So that is suffered the same temperature change Active guards mounted in one of the wisdom bridge The other dummy one is in the other arm,  the effect of the temperatureincluding this, can be cancelled out because of these twolike we say, rg one and rg twolike these two.  So we're seeing the Instagram, but it's the true the two resistors more Here is a more how we can get to the connection between this circuit and also the sceneries present previously.

那么这意味着这两个都可以感知温度，但只有两个。活跃的人能感觉到力量。因为我们认为你的时间是横向位置关闭。靠近活动端口。那就是遭受了同样的温度变化。安装在其中一座智慧桥上的主动守卫另一个假人在另一只手臂上，温度的影响包括这个，因为这两个可以抵消掉。就像我们说的，RG 1和RG 2就像这两个。所以我们看到了Instagram，但它是真正的两个电阻更多这里是一个更多的方法，我们可以得到这之间的联系电路以及先前呈现的场景。

So we can analyze vs.  Vs is here. We have the a and C both connected to the source, like we have here, a and C. This is the source We have rg one and rg two, which this is the true resistors in one, are like, for example, we are strong, and it's in the abcrFor the adcr is the one is active. Another is done Once again, temperature affects both, but it does not affect the balance, because temperature effect is applied to both of them.  They will change proportionally like the like the R that will be equal to R 01 flight and one plus Alpha T.  This is the relation we have tell you before this one and resistance change after temperature not like is the R one, okr two is the same R zero one plus

所以我们可以在这里分析VS和VS。我们把A和C都连接到源头，就像我们这里的，A和C。这是源头我们有RG 1和RG 2，这是真正的电阻，例如，我们很强，它在ABCR中。因为ADCR是激活的。另一个完成了同样，温度对两者都有影响，但不影响平衡，因为温度效应应用于它们两者。它们将按比例变化，如就像R将等于R一样。01飞行和一加阿尔法T。这是我们之间的关系在这之前告诉你。和温度后电阻变化不像是R 1，OKR 2是相同的R 01加

How about you If we divide the R one over R two,  you will immediately see this change in the temperature one plus Alpha T, whether they will cancel each other,  the ratio is still the same. I will want to equals zero. I want prime over R two prime.  There's the old and the new between the temperature change.  It will be the same But on the other side,  the strength, however, will only affects rg two. And this produce output voltage from the bridge This is the effect, but both of them are influenced by the same temperature.  But but the strain is only suffered by one. So this will generate the difference if no strange change, and this will be a balanced at the original, right

你呢如果我们把R1除以R2，你会立即看到温度的变化，1加上αT，它们是否会相互抵消，比率仍然相同。我会想要等于零。我想要素数除以两个素数。有旧的和新的。在温度变化之间。会是一样的。但另一方面，强度只会影响RG 2。并且这从电桥产生输出电压这是效果，但两者都受到相同温度的影响。但是但这种压力只有一个人承受。所以这将产生区别如果没有奇怪的变化，这将是一个平衡在原来的，对不对？

If there because of both of them, they are in the same temperature,  the effect of the temperature change in the castle. So it will still be bestBut if there is some strange change,  so we say the when subject to strength only rg two, ok becomesthere is this rg two plus third rg two ok.  We can extract the rg two and only left of the change over the original in the resistance.  There are over the original R. Will you close to G so long? Because this is the definition of the jungles, because we introduced last lecture S this is just a simple relation, G here is this strong coefficient.  This is COSTA usually is between2 to 3, I think The last lecture we have introduced this G is a constant, and this one, this parameter is subject to the stressThis is a measurement of the strength Quite. So thereforethere's also afterwards this after this change this one will be the new output ok.  It's rg two one plus G epsilon over rt one plus H two times exchange minus R two over R one plus R two This is a competition This isWhat is it should be there Mean, meaning is the change in this output is because we have- previous one, which is zero.

如果因为它们两者都存在，它们在相同的温度下，城堡里的温度变化。所以这仍然是最好的。但是如果有一些奇怪的变化，那么我们说那当只受RG两个强度的影响时，OK变为有这个RG 2加上第三个RG 2好的。我们可以提取RG两个，并且只剩下对原始的更改在抵抗运动中。有超过原来的R。你会接近G这么久吗？因为这是丛林的定义，因为我们在上节课介绍过。这是只是一个简单的关系，这里是G这是强系数。这是科斯塔我想通常在2到3之间。我们介绍的最后一节课这个G是一个常数，而这个，这个参数受应力的影响。这是实力的衡量标准。相当。所以因此在这个变化之后也有这个。这个会是。新输出正常。它是RG21加Gε除以RT 1加H 2乘以交换减R2除以R1加R2这是一场比赛。这是是什么？它应该在那里意思是，这个输出的变化是因为我们有-上一个是零。

We out here,  you can try to compute this one.  If we assume simplified the R one equals zero two rg one is also the same as rtqBut you'll see that this is here becomes half because they're equals to each other Here will be one plus GS one plus over 1 plus This is the same1 plus 1 plus section 3. Do you like thisFor example, after we get to this step,  because this onethis Jefferson, this is strange,  this strange, this is a strange change, corresponds to the trend of resistance,  as we mentioned, the change of the resistance is much smaller compared to the original one. Okay We say this one G strong is a much smallerlike a 01.  It's much smaller than two

我们在这里，你可以试着计算这个。如果我们假设简化的R等于02RG One也与RTQ相同但你会看到这是这里变成了一半，因为它们彼此相等。这里将是一加GS一加超过1+这是相同的1加1加第3节你喜欢这个吗？例如，在我们到达这一步之后，因为这一步这个杰弗逊，这很奇怪，这很奇怪，这是一个奇怪的变化，对应着阻力的趋势，就像我们提到的，阻力的变化比原来的小得多。好的我们说这个。G强是一个小得多的就像01。它比2小得多

We can neglect to this part, this job,  the denominator We take it outThat gives us the vs gsgsl or phone. So it's this is a change that the V out equals twoThat's right. So we can write it like thisThe previous parameters, we all both all of them are constant Vs is a voltage source.  It's constant G, as we say, here is a constant between 2 to 3 over four.  This is a constant left to the the strength of which is a linearthe limitation of the output voltagethe odds, which is a linear with respect to a strength

我们可以忽略这个部分，这个工作，分母我们把它拿出来。这给了我们VSGSGSL或电话。所以这是这是一个V输出等于2的变化。对的。所以我们可以这样写。前面的参数，我们都是常数。VS是电压源。它是常数G，正如我们所说，这里是2到3之间的一个常数。超过四个。这是一个常数。左至其强度是线性的输出电压的限制几率，是线性的就力量而言

As also you have seen here,  because we maintained this ratio temperature change, it can be neglected because they both in the numerator denominator, they are affected by the temperature, so they will cancel each other This doesn't change who is a temperature anymore,  only suffers from the strength.  This is the only only effect that can change the notebooks is the first one. So this is the simplest one we only use,  because in this western bridge, we have four resistance. So we only use one arm adcr. That's what we say. One is suffer to strengthen. The other is notBut we can have a more complex.  So we say we can have this too active and too dummy is placed on the other side of the place on the same side of this material.

正如你在这里看到的，因为我们保持了这个温度变化的比率，它可以被忽略，因为它们都在分子分母中，它们受温度的影响，所以它们会相互抵消。这并不能改变谁是温度不再，只受强度的影响。这是唯一的唯一可以的效果换笔记本是第一个。所以这是最简单的一个，我们只用它，因为在这个西方的桥上，我们有四个阻力。所以我们只用一只手臂。ADCR。我们就是这么说的。一是承受能力增强。另一个不是。但我们可以有一个更复杂的。所以我们说我们可以让它太活跃，太呆板。是放在同一边的另一边的地方。这种材料的。

And so it means these two will suffer the same strength, right? This one will not suffer stress We say R R two and rg three the actual one, they are attitude and largest three. That means these two you have to choose your time We say rg two and rg three, right? In this cross section direction. So is the active because the attitude that I okay. So the thing is that the the point is the first point because they still don't suffer the temperature You areIt's a western breach, as you can The ratio between the rg one and rg two, rg three and four, they are very close to each other temperature of them, you can think, is the same.  The temperature doesn't influence the ratio to divide the voltageAnd also there are two okig three, rg three, but is suffering the the strength

所以这意味着这两个人将遭受同样的力量，对吗？这个不会承受压力。我们说R R 2和RG 3实际上，它们是态度和最大的三个。这意味着这两个。你必须选择你的时间我们说RG 2和RG 3，对吗？在这个横截面方向。所以是积极的，因为我的态度很好。那么问题是点是第一点，因为它们还是不要忍受温度你是如你所知，这是西方的突破。RG 1和RG 2之间的比率，RG三和四，他们非常接近。他们彼此的温度，你可以认为，是一样的。温度不影响分压比还有有两个OKIG三，RG三，但正在遭受力量

But these two, they don't. So this is the character of these are too active and too daring Not the thereAs we say here, the facts reinforce one another to give double the output voltage of the single active strain garbage.  This is the V out. So that way you can try to derive this relation. But the benefiting that here is the double of the change We can see in the previous one,  if we only use one active wang da ming ok. So it's the V SG and the S time strain over four. But here is a we asked Jefferson over twoThere's a temperature compensation is still a ship So that meansas well as I mentioned earlier,  it's because they are in the same temperature,  even if the temperature change they will by the dividing this voltage will cancel each other

但这两个人，他们没有。那么这就是这些人的性格太活跃、太大胆了。不是那里正如我们在这里所说的，事实是相辅相成的输出电压是单输出电压的两倍活性菌株垃圾。这是V出。这样你就可以试着推导出这个关系。但这里的好处是变化的两倍。我们可以在上一个中看到，如果我们只使用一个活跃的王大明OK。所以这是V SG和S时间应变超过4。但这里有一个我们问了杰斐逊两个以上。有一个温度补偿仍然是一艘船所以这意味着正如我前面提到的，这是因为它们处于相同的温度，即使温度发生变化通过分压，该电压将相互抵消

For the analysis Who can still write, right? Like the V hot, right? To be out of this beyond of this circuitAs we see the difference between the two It's the we asked, right? So we say it's a that is just to use a minus B here.  It's the rg two over rg one plus budget minus LG four It can still write in this in this way. So it's always right to just with some bridge. So it's dividing the input voltage vs. And so it isBut the.is they are racial between the resistors It's rgq, and rg four The message has to check.  So what is active? So it's rg twoAnd rg three ok just be sure you find the correct resistor

为了分析谁还能写，对吧？就像V很热，对吧？摆脱这一切。超出此电路正如我们所看到的差异两者之间这是我们问过了，对吧？所以我们说它是一个就是在这里用a减去B。它是RG二加RG一加预算减去LG四它还能用这个写字。以这种方式。所以公正总是对的用一些桥。因此，它将输入电压与。事实也是如此。但他们是种族之间的。电阻器它是RGQ和RG4信息必须检查。那么什么是主动呢？所以它是RG 2RG 3好的，确保你找到了正确的电阻

Ok,  it's rg two and rg three. And so rg twowho says equals to the original one times one plus G times itself.  This is something it suffers from the strength Rgrgrg three is rgSame.  It's rg two and rg three, the active or G three This is rg three suffering to the strength. We will have some change We just plug in this resistors after strength to the original,  to the voltage dividing.  So it gives, right, rg two 1+ the work of rg one plus rg 2 minus. So is the part in the I just really right24 is the same R GC This is the new relation, but there is a so easy

好的，这是RG 2和RG 3。所以RG二谁说等于原来的一倍一加G乘以自身。这是它所遭受的力量。RGRGRG三是RG同样的。它是RG 2和RG 3，活动的或G 3这是RG三个痛苦的力量。我们会有一些变化。我们只要插上这个。电阻强度改为原来的强度后，再进行分压。所以它给出，对，RG 21+, RG One的工作加上RG 2, 减。所以I中的部分真的是对的吗？24是一样的。R GC, 这是新的关系，但有一个太容易了

We have the rg oneHow sorry to you? This is a strength. And then here's strength.  You see that these two are not the same. One in the numerator. There is one plus G epsilon.  in one zero in the denominator. You have to tell me So we say we can try to simplify it. So this one just visitors, so you cancel each other, right? Just the one plus You have shown over1+ minus So it's the the final ok.  This is you see, the denominator is the same. This is a two plus epsilon, but this is a numerator ok.  It's only the G G epsilon,  because one will cancel each other

我们有RG的。有多对不起你？这是一种力量。然后这里是力量。你看这两个是不一样的。分子中的一个。有一个加gε。分母中的10你得告诉我。所以我们说我们可以试着简化它。所以这个只是。访客，所以你们互相取消，对吗？只有一加你已经出现了。1+, 减所以这是最后的OK。这是你看，分母是一样的。这是一个2+ε，但这是一个分子。它只是G G epsilon，因为一个会相互抵消。

We can, another thing is that we can neglect this compared to the truth,  because as we mentioned, Jeff's room is much smaller than two. So this one can be cancelled.  I It is what gives us the equals to as avsok It's because in the denominator,  there are 21+1 for two with the vsG epsilon over two and Z one as a pencil charge This is the relation.  Let me know there is true same as the vsgsn over two. This is the thing we want.

我们可以，另一件事是我们可以忽略这与事实相比，因为正如我们所提到的，杰夫的房间比两个小得多。所以这个可以取消。我它给了我们平等作为阿夫索克这是因为在分母中，有21+1表示两个VS。Gε除以2和Z1作为铅笔电荷这就是关系。让我知道这是真的。与2上的VSGSN相同。这是我们想要的东西

So generally, you will see the way to analyze this wisdom breach.  The first thing is to write down the output.  What is the output voltage The second thing is to check what is happening to the resistors,  whether it's softer from temperature, always started from a strand. Right?  You just write down what is changed and plug in this plug into this equation After that, the third point is that once you have a computer finished the computation, just in the,  you can always say that the G epsilon this change is small compared to one or compared to two,  this one can be directed in the denominator When he was, you can just analyze what's your remains This is the idea of analyzing this with some bridge more complex

所以一般来说，你会看到分析这个智慧缺口的方法。第一件事是写下来。输出。输出电压是多少第二件事是检查。电阻发生了什么变化，它是否因温度而变软，总是从一条线开始。对的？你只要写下改变了什么。插上这个。插入这个等式在那之后，第三点是，一旦你有一台计算机完成了计算，就在，你总是可以说G这个变化与1相比是很小的，或者与2相比是很小的，这个变化可以指向分母当他是的时候，你可以分析你的遗体是什么这是用一些桥梁来分析这个的想法。更复杂

We have this four active gorges,  we say we say we have four, and for all of them are active That means R one, rgr two. I just write the four ok, but the rt two and rg three. And you will see they are always in the cross section H two and rg three.  They are upside because this is on the downside rgq and rg threeIt's all up. And so this is on the downside. All right This one are the same, these 21, and 4 are the same The position of the course in British children so that there are, in fact, reinforce one another to give 4 times the output this time this will be out equals to just avs hard suggestion.  It's not like over four in the one, I think what I mean and not like to actually two time is over two, but the four, all of them are active.

我们有这个我们说，四个活跃的峡谷我们说我们有四个，因为它们都是活动的。意思是R一，RGR2。我只写了四个OK，但是RT 2和RG 3。你会看到的它们总是在横截面上。H 2和RG 3。他们是有利的，因为这是不利的。RGQ和RG三一切都结束了。所以这是在不利方面好吧这个是一样的，这21个和4个是一样的课程在英国儿童中的地位有，事实上，相互加强，给出4倍的输出，这一次，这将是等于只是AVS的硬建议。它不像四岁以上的孩子一，我想我的意思并不像实际上两次超过两次，而是四次，他们都是活跃的。

So it's vs times suggestion Because these are is still balanced, but they are in the same piece of material.  We can assume temperature understand the temperature compensation is achieved because the ratio is not changed Because all of them are putting the same temperature There are these four. And the advantage is that it gives larger output.  Later on, we will see why this is important because generally, this is very small. You can see the G absolute, as we say, is much smaller than one.  The output this V out will still be very small If we can get this 4 times then they are one at one time in Europe. So this will be very beneficial for us to analyze the signal This is the for active, gorgeous We can also try to analyze this one following the very same

所以它是VS时代建议因为这些是仍然是平衡的，但它们在同一块材料中。我们可以假设温度理解，因为比率没有改变，所以实现了温度补偿因为他们都把同样的温度有这四个。优点是输出更大。稍后，我们将看到为什么这很重要，因为一般来说，这个很小。你可以看到，正如我们所说的，绝对G值比1小得多。输出这个V输出仍然很小。如果我们能得到这个4次然后他们在欧洲同时是一个。所以这对我们分析信号会非常有利。这是活跃的，华丽的我们也可以试着用同样的方法来分析这个

And as process as for the V out vsSome of what you want to choose. And article fourRight now. So all these are resistors, but the sufferings are change, suffering the strength,  the rg two and rg three. They are up and they are suffering the same We can see that the upside is a stretch, right It comes longerBut for the rg one and rg four, we are down. Right? So they are actually screening.  So there they become shorter We have mentioned that we are introducing strength. The strength actually have directions. So that gives us this because rgqrg two and rg three, right there, they are stretching. And so that means they are receiving this positive. Thank you For the rg one and rg four ok, because you are squeezing they are actually receiving the negative strength

以及作为用于V输出的过程与一些你想要选择的和第四条马上。所以这些都是电阻，但痛苦的是变化，痛苦的力量，RG二和RG三。他们站起来了，他们也在遭受同样的痛苦。我们可以看到上行是一种延伸，对吧？它来得更久但对于RG 1和RG 4，我们落后了。对的？所以他们实际上是在筛选。所以它们变得更短了。我们已经提到我们正在引入力量。力量其实是有方向的。所以这给了我们这个，因为RGQRG 2和RG 3，就在那里，它们正在伸展。所以这意味着他们正在接受这种积极的谢谢对于RG 1和RG 4，好的，因为你在挤压他们实际上是在接受负面的力量。

We say rg oneWhy do you want rg four,  as you can see, arg one minus Sure. So because they are receiving some screening strengths. And so sign here will be opposite. So the two and three stretching is pointedOne and four, we are screening because there are contracting.  This is a negative.  Next. We can plug in all of this into the into the original vrok. So it's equals to vsrg two. Right? So it's the one plus I will just take out the rg here because they will always cancel each otherQuestion is the rg two the article is one minusWhat's article is 1 plus minus rg four, which is one minus You will see that in the denominator right on the below,  there are always these two are the same. So it's always 1 minusThere is 1-1, and there is a 1.10 K.

我们说RG一为什么你想要RG 4，正如你所看到的，ARG 1减一定。因为他们正在接受一些筛选强度。所以这里的符号是相反的。所以二次和三次拉伸是有针对性的。一号和四号，我们正在筛选，因为有合同。这是否定的。下一个。我们可以把所有这些都插入到变成了原来的Vrok。所以这是等于VSRG 2。对的？所以它是一加。我将在这里去掉RG，因为它们总是会相互抵消。问题是RG 2文章是一个减号。什么文章是1加？减去RG 4，也就是1减你会看到在下面的分母中，总是有这两个是相同的。所以它总是1减有1-1，还有一个1.10 K。

These true strengths, they will cancel each other G epsilon It will give us vsok two over one plus G epsilon would youThere's one-2002 This is the difference, and you can just compute this one. The question is true to solve true and equals vs You will see one plus is a strength, and the one minus to this minus one plus ok.  This is a close one, will cancel,  right? There are one left few timesAbsolutely. And then over two, so they will give us vsShe also. So this is the same we have shown here, but this is beyond. So it's vs times G. Absolutely.  It's 4 times, then the one active, one dummy, and 2 times larger than the check into that, because this is now gives us the largest output

这些真正的力量，它们会相互抵消。它会给我们VSOK两个以上一加Gε你会吗有一个-2002, 这就是差异，你可以只计算这个。问题是真的，解决是真的。并且等于VS你会看到一加是一种力量，一减到这个减一加就可以了。这是一个接近的，将取消，对不对？有一个离开了几次绝对地。然后超过两个，所以他们会给我们VS她也。所以这是一样的我们已经在这里展示了，但这是超越。所以它是VS乘以G。当然。它是4倍，然后是一个活动的，一个虚拟的，比2倍大检查一下，因为这是现在给我们最大的输出

This is the for active, gorgeous analysis,  just remember, this is the largest one, and so it's vs times the goals are proficient and also harm the strength But later on, you will see this is still very small.  So that is also the reason why they need to use the amplifier Now,  let's just have a tennis breakThat is46

这是对于活跃的，华丽的分析，只是记住，这是最大的一个，所以它是VS有时目标是熟练的，也会损害力量。但稍后，你会看到这仍然很小。那么这也是他们需要使用放大器的原因现在，我们休息一下打网球吧。那是46

03月08日 10时07分


Of this temperature compensationOkay One word for certain.  So this is for the strange words. Quite soThe strength also is a sensor to measure strength.  Our objective is still to measure strength. Nothing about the we want to know how much the temperature is second is the temperature compensationThe reason why we use this temperature compensation is that a stranger as this metal sensor,  it will suffer from the influence of temperature. That means if the temperature change,  resistance of the strategy will also change, even if you didn't have any strength we will compensate this temperatureThat is to use this with some bridge.  We press what? We press these two in the same temperature,  even if temperature change the ratio dividing this voltage, it does not change.

这种温度补偿好的有一句话可以肯定。所以这是为了奇怪的话。的确如此力量也是测量力量的传感器。我们的目标仍然是衡量实力。没有关于我们想知道温度是多少其次是温度。补偿我们使用这种温度补偿的原因就像这个金属传感器一样，它会受到温度的影响。那意味着如果温度发生变化，抵抗的策略也会发生变化，即使你没有任何力量。我们将补偿这个温度那就是把这个和一些桥一起使用。我们按什么？我们按这两个。在同一温度下，即使温度发生变化分割这个电压的比率，它不会改变。

So that mean, this is the way to eliminate the effect of temperatureAnd also, if we can also see from the from this to be out the output equal to vsg. And from over four,  the thing is that they are you need to understand is that the change of the water managerthis way out,  this output we get is proportional to also,  this is a strength, because the thing is that all output is proportional to your strength, not proportional to some temperature or anything.  The temperature effect has been eliminated What we want to measure is the current The same thing applies to like this. There is a one active one dummy, or even the two active two dummy,  all the later on. These are so active The objective here is always the same to measure the strength.

所以这意味着，这是消除温度影响的方法而且，如果我们也能从由此输出等于VSG的输出。从四个以上，问题是他们是你需要明白的是，水经理的变化这样，我们得到的输出正比于而且，这是一种力量，因为所有的输出都与你的力量成正比，而不是与温度或任何东西成正比。温度效应已消除我们要测量的是电流。同样的事情也适用于这样的情况。有一个活动的一个假人，甚至两个活动的两个假人，所有的稍后。这些太活跃了。这里的目标总是一样的。来衡量实力。

But the only difference is that this for active gives the largest output It's 4 times, then the one active one I and 2 times a larger than the structure of Cuban We say the benefits of this for active is that it gives us the largest output Here is thisAnother issue is the amplification of the bridge output. Okay We say you can notice,  even if it's the largest one, is the vs times gf zero,  you will see is this value is still very small. So for example,  we have this full active course, rightWe asked because of vs times.  So usually this one, this strength is very small because when you are stretching on the record, so I think it cannot be very large

但唯一的区别是，这对于主动给出最大的输出它是4倍，然后一个活跃的I和2倍A比古巴的结构更大我们说这对Active的好处是它给了我们最大的输出。这里是这个另一个问题是电桥输出的放大。好的我们说你可以注意到，即使它是最大的一个，是VS乘以GF 0，你会看到这个值仍然是非常小。例如，我们有这个完整的活动课程，对吧？我们问是因为VS时代。所以通常这个，这个力量很小，因为当你在记录上拉伸时，我认为它不可能很大。

If it's a one mu, which is ten power of-6,  it's always a very small strength.  The vs ten G is some awesome and interest to reading VR is that the2.2×10to the power of-5,  this is already very smallEven if we consider the largest strength, which is10,000 mu, it only gives us the largest is 0.22 volts This gives us that the output voltageit's actually like between 0 to 0.22.  It's the votes. This is actually a very small, a range of the change. And typically we will not make the strength this large.  It's always some are small and medium change of the shape so that it cannot reach, normally it cannot reach 0.22

如果它是一个1MU，也就是6的10次方，它总是一个非常小的强度。VS十G是一些令人敬畏和感兴趣的是阅读VR的2.2×10的-5次方，这已经很小了。即使我们考虑最大的力量，也就是一万亩，也只能给我们最大的。为0.22伏这为我们提供了输出电压它实际上是在0到0.22之间。这是选票。这其实是一个很小的，一个范围的变化。通常我们不会把强度做得这么大。总是有一些是小的和中等的。形状的变化使它不能达到，通常它不能达到0.22

There is a limit to the size of supply voltage vs We cannot make it too large like a supply with 1,000 voltage. And that is undoable because this is will lead to the power station The power distribution is like the heat effect in this resistorsDo you like in the stray materials?  Because all those are metals if we apply a large voltage, so there will be a large energy consumption in this system This is why we will like only provide some medium voltage number like to ten, like five, like two. So we cannot make a true and very large. Yes That means the output of the from the recent bridge that we always be very low, right? Just like this or 10 to the power-5 in 19-4-3. And so that this is the price where we will use some amplifier as we can hear. Good, because all the values are very small, and so we need to make it larger

电源电压Vs的大小存在限制我们不能让它变得太大，就像1000伏的电源一样。这是不可行的，因为这将导致发电站功率分布类似于该电阻器中的热效应你喜欢杂散的材料吗？因为所有这些都是金属，如果我们施加很大的电压，那么在这个系统中就会有很大的能量消耗。这就是为什么我们只提供一些中等电压的数字，比如10，比如5，比如2。所以我们不能做一个真正的和非常大的是的这意味着输出的从最近的桥我们总是很低，对吧？就像这个或者19-4-3中的10的5次方。所以这就是价格我们将使用一些放大器正如我们所听到的。很好，因为所有的值都很小，所以我们需要把它变大。

You make a proportional amplifier such that it can be measured, can be used to output, can be used for controlQuite. So this is comes to the amplifiers. Okay Motivated by here, most of this output from the recent bridge is very small. So we will use some amplifiers very brief introduction of this operational amplifier. So it's brigade as op dash a and B and opamp with the operation operational amplifier it can be considered to be a system which has the input and output the voltage scan of the amplifier in the ratio of output over the input as we have a plot herebut we have an input voltageLike this is from from this one, right? To from the wisdom bridge.  It's,  for example, we have the 2.2, right? 10 to the power of-5 is 2.2This is an inputcatch the power minus 5 input So perhaps we will have an input current goes through the amplifier,  the output, a voltage

你做一个比例放大器，这样它就可以被测量，可以用来输出，可以用来控制。相当。这就是放大器。好的在这里的激励下，最近桥的大部分输出都很小。所以我们将使用一些放大器。这个很简单的介绍。运算放大器。所以这是作为运放的破折号A和B与运放一起操作的运算放大器它可以被认为是一个具有输入和输出的系统，放大器的电压扫描以输出对输入的比率进行。因为我们在这里有一个情节但我们有一个输入电压就像这是从从这个开始，对吧？从智慧桥到。例如，我们有2.2，对吗？10的-5次方是2.2这是一个输入。捕捉功率减5输入所以也许我们将有一个输入电流通过放大器，输出，电压

Let's see if the and play again, right? Amplify again is 10 to the power of-5. Okay After the amplifier. So it will be just in large. So the output will be to question.  So this one is more acceptable and more measurable, right? So that we can use some voltage meter right to measure like the output This is the function of amplifier just to make the signal largerwhich is the amplitude larger Basis of many signal conditioning modules is the operation of the amplifier. Okay This is because amplifier is very important in the signal conditioning. So it is a heightened DC amplifier. I can keep your body in the order of a hundred of my supply Apollo five for more. So it's very large If we applied to the western bridge, I immediately we can get on acceptable output like the 2.2 volts

让我们看看再玩一次，对吗？再次放大是10的-5次方。好的在放大器之后。所以它会很大。所以输出将是质疑。所以这个更容易接受，也更容易衡量，对吧？这样我们就可以使用一些电压表正确测量比如输出这是放大器的功能，只是为了使信号更大。哪个振幅更大？许多信号调理模块的基础是放大器的操作。好的这是因为放大器非常重要。在信号调节中。所以它是一个增强的直流放大器。我可以把你的身体保持在我阿波罗五号的一百个补给的数量级。为了更多。所以这是非常大如果我们应用于西部电桥，我们可以立即获得可接受的输出，如2.2伏。

Here is the stock is simple.  This is a complete one It's a complete single. And we have you, if you observe this symbol here, it has the input, it has two inputs. This one is plus, this one is minus This is plus input refers to a non inverting input to the minus is the inverted inputSo inverting input is that you can term-2+ Now you're working is that it's to maintain the same side Another thing is that we have this plus vs and minus S.  This is a power source It's a supply. The voltage is- because this amplifier, we need to input some energyOtherwise, it cannot just you put one risk here and don't give any power. So you can amplify, I'd like to attend to the power five. So that is possible It must have some energy input to make the signal level

这里的股票很简单。这是一个完整的。这是一首完整的单曲。如果你观察这个符号，它有输入，它有两个输入。这个是另外，这个是负号。这是正输入，指的是同相输入，负输入是反相输入。所以反相输入是你可以第2+项现在你在工作，是不是保持同一立场另一件事是我们有这个正VS和负S，这是一个电源。这是补给。电压为─因为这个放大器，我们需要输入一些能量。否则，它不能只是你把一个风险放在这里，而不给任何权力。所以你可以放大，我想要注意力量五。所以这是可能的。它必须有一定的能量输入才能使信号电平

This is the power source. So we have so plus BS and minus BS Normally,  when we are giving some problems or some illustrations, so we can put it here, but we can also not put it here Are you ready for the simplification? We will ask, just delay, delete this supply voltage plus minus vs.  Usually we will only see this triangle with you put a lot of points all who is here to be out There is also a model here. This is the ideal model, ok.  It's input which is there is something I include a resistance that are in.  Here is something some device like this They will change this AV vin. This is the input voltage.  It will give a ratio and then enlarge it. And there is output the coreaccording this amplifier is this existing here

这是电源。所以我们有正B和负B通常，当我们给出一些问题或者一些说明，所以我们可以把它放在这里，但是我们也可以不把它放在这里。你准备好简化了吗？我们会问，只需延迟，删除此电源电压正负，而通常我们只会看到这个三角形你放了很多分。所有在这里的人都要出去。这里也有一个模型。这是理想的模型，好的。它是输入也就是说，我在其中加入了一些阻力。这是一些像这样的设备。他们将更改此AV VIN。这是输入电压。它会给出一个比例，然后放大它。而且有输出。核心根据这个放大器是这个存在于此

That's way to go on in March The input will amplify the input Just one thing to highlight is this symbol hereHas this a non inverted input inverted input, and this output Sometimes we can have this, if you see, is this input supply voltage can be don't feel strange. So this is the power sourceAnd also in the most of the casewe just take the input water should be asking and we asked out, so you will not see this. But if you see it of your strange Next one is this ideal personal amplifier This is what we hope is a perfect amplifier Ideal model for amplifier is that the infinite gain, because it means this ABC is amplified voltage of the how much you enlarge it.

这就是三月的生活方式输入将放大输入只有一件事高亮显示的是这个符号。这是非反相输入吗？反向输入，而这个输出有时我们可以有这个，如果你看到，这是输入电源电压可以是，不要觉得奇怪。这就是能量源。而且在大多数情况下我们只是把应该问的水输入进去，而我们问出来了，所以你不会看到这个。但如果你看到你的陌生人下一个是理想的个人放大器。这是我们希望的是一个完美的放大器。放大器的理想模型是无限增益，因为它意味着这个ABC被放大了。你把它的电压放大多少。

Maybe we say it tends to infinity. That's what it isInfinity can It's also,  so there you will see you might be a bit confused.  Why is thisAv is infinityBecause if it's normally we wanted to have some numbers like the how about five? But because it's an ideal for partial F amplifier,  I will hope it will be infinity infinite again here, right? Means device is useless without adding the feedbackthe controls over again to find the value The way we control itbecause I increase like a fixed number, right? So we cannot change it. So normally we want normally, what we want is that inside the amplifier, this is infinity. On the other side, you can set connect some I like the resistance might be structured on the surface to control what is how much it will be able to find This is giving,  adding some feedback.

也许我们说它趋于无穷大。就是这样。无限可以它也是，所以在那里你会看到你可能有点困惑。这是为什么AV是无穷大因为如果它是正常的，我们希望有一些数字，如五个怎么样？但因为它是部分F放大器的理想选择，我希望它在这里再次无限无限，对吗？手段如果不添加反馈，设备将毫无用处控件再次查找该值。我们控制它的方式因为我增加了就像一个固定的数字，对吗？所以我们无法改变它。所以通常我们想要通常，我们想要的是在放大器内部，这是无限大。在另一边，你可以设置连接一些我喜欢的阻力，可能是在表面上构造的，以控制它能找到多少。这是给予，加上一些反馈。

The output depends on the connection made to the inputs a little.  You will understandWhat does this mean here?  Generally, we will think what we say is that we want inside is infinity, but outside can be controlled by the collections We have the infinite can infinite input impedance.  It means the input are in, okay It's easierAre in that is here are so easy. Inputs is infinity and zero output impedance out out is the resistance here We want the infinity inputPerhaps this is infinity, and the hours is zero That means if the arguing is infinity, right, there will not be any current This current here will always be zero. And this is a symbol.  We have this V plus, V minus. This is true input, and we have the V out We here are we just like thatThe power source, when you see the vs was missing

输出稍微依赖于与输入的连接。你会明白的这是什么意思？一般来说，我们会认为我们所说的是我们想要的内部是无限的，但外部是可以控制的。通过收藏我们有无限也可以无限输入阻抗。这意味着输入已经输入了，好吗？这样更容易在那是在这里太容易了输入为无穷大和零输出阻抗OUT出去是这里有阻力我们想要无限输入。也许这就是无限，而小时就是零。这意味着如果争论是无限的，对，就不会有任何电流。这里的电流永远是零。和这是一个象征。我们有这个V+，V-。这是真正的输入，我们有V输出我们在这里，我们就像那样电源，当你看到VS不见了。

We only left this one for the a single representation The thing of the infinite input impedance and zero output impedance gives us This is actually determined by the are infinite input impedance.  If you see this won't give us this I plus equals to I minus C is zero, because the impedance is infinityTherefore, it will give us both currents a zero and V plus ok equals to V minus, because there is no current inside This means that these two are always equal This is the mentors to analyze the amplifier I understand that it might be a bit confusing. You ask, why is this This might be still understandable because the input impedance is infinity.  There is no current. But for this one, the V plus equal to V minus, if you cannot understand ityou can just use it. This is because these two are very straightforward and very convenient tools to analyze the amplifier Let's try with this first one.  So it's the inverted amplifier This is the connection the way we connectThat's all you will see. How you will see is actually this amplifier is always the sameSo that what's changed is the way we connect the resistors in the outside looking keep these two rules in your mind with I plus equals I minus equal to zero and V plus equal V minus is ready to hear. We must be close 3 months and I plus moments are both zeroOkayLike here, the plusvn minus, and there's I plus I minus00 We say that these two, right? The voltage is a standard of V plus equals to V minusBecause V plus is connecting the ground,  its voltage is zero.

我们只把这个留给了一个单身代表无限大的输入阻抗和零输出阻抗给出了这实际上是由是无限大的输入阻抗。如果你看到这不会给我们这个I+等于I-C是零，因为阻抗是无限大的。因此，它会给我们两股电流零和V+OK等于V-，因为内部没有电流这意味着这两个总是相等的。这是导师要分析的放大器。我知道这可能有点令人困惑。你问，这是为什么？这可能仍然是可以理解的，因为输入阻抗是无穷大。没有电流。但对于这个，如果你不能理解的话，V+等于V-你可以用它。这是因为这两个人非常用于分析放大器的简单而方便的工具让我们试试第一个。所以它是倒置的放大器这就是我们连接的方式。这就是你所能看到的。你将看到的是，实际上这个放大器总是一样的。所以改变的是我们联系的方式。外面的电阻看起来记住这两条规则，I+等于I-等于零，V+等于V-。准备好听了。我们一定很近。3个月和I+力矩均为零好的就像这里，加号VN减，还有I加I减00我们说这两个，对吧？电压是V+等于V-的标准因为V+接地，所以其电压为零。

What level is zero?  Here is also zero We can analyze the outside.  So you say that the Vyou can assume the outside current is in this direction,  because there's no current here.  I minus is zero.  The current only exists in this oneOkay? So there is only kind of in this line here we say that is all of the currents that we aren't over or two.  You can write like here Here they are connected because of V V minus equal to 3 plus is 0.  We say we ask for are true equals to 0- li ying equals over are one. Right We can say immediately V out over V in equals to minus. Aren't you over and over This analyze, if you check these two efficiency, it might be very easy to get, but it actually includes like the key steps to analyze this amplifier

零是什么水平？这里也是零。我们可以分析一下外面。那么你说V你可以假设外部电流在这个方向，因为这里没有电流。I减为零。电流只存在于这一个。好的？所以只有一种在这条线上我们说这是所有我们不是的潮流超过一两个。你可以像这里这样写。在这里，它们是因为V V负而连接的等于3加是0。我们说我们要求是真的等于0-李英等于超过是一个对的我们可以直接说V out/V in等于负数。你不是吗一遍又一遍这个分析，如果你检查这两个效率，它可能很容易得到，但它实际上包括像关键步骤。来分析这个放大器

What we assume is that this these two voltage the same, there's no current Based on that work. Based on these two relations, we can analyze the outside circuitsAnd then you notice the idea there is no current in the branch.  The current only exists in the main sides main way in this path, right It's easy. So we can analyze like the current to establish the relations between the V out and V in You also see the thing we want. Finally, what we want is that the relation between the V RS and beingWe always remember this is what we want to be out the beginning. And so another is that the if we just look at these results here the amplifier, this is V out or vn equals to R two over R one.

我们假设的是这两个电压相同，没有电流基于那项工作。基于这两个关系，我们可以分析外部电路。然后你会注意到，分支中没有电流。电流只存在于主侧主路。在这条路上，对吗？这很容易。因此，我们可以像分析电流一样，建立V输出和V输入之间的关系你也看到了我们想要的东西。最后，我们想要的是VRS之间的关系和存在我们永远记得这是我们想要的。开头。所以另一个是如果我们只看这些结果放大器，这是Vout或VN等于R2除以R1。

These two resistors is something we can choose, like we choose part two as one KWhat is the? R one is only 100 K This time, the V out over V in is the minus. What are you doing This is like the amplify again1,000. This is also the reason why we call it inverted amplifier because this makes change the science and system is-1,000If the wing a is a positive, the field will be negative This is the inverted amplifierAnd another one, another pointsPreviously, we say the why we want the infinite again is that the output depends on the connections made to the inputs and to read this sentence hereOutput depends on the connections made to the inputThis is a clear example.  An amplifier can is determined by R two and one. R one is the connection outside in the output and input,  it's is that the number, if I can determined by the output connection, is by the outside connection,  you can just changechange the amplifier again, right?

我们可以选择这两个电阻，就像我们选择第二部分一样。是什么？R1只有100K这一次，V OUT除以V IN是负数你在干什么这又像是放大器。1,000.这也是我们称之为反相放大器的原因。改变科学和系统是-1，000如果翼A为正，则场将为负这是反相放大器。另一个，另一个点以前，我们说过为什么我们想要无限的原因是输出取决于与输入和在这里读这句话输出取决于与输入的连接这是一个明显的例子。放大器可以由R 2和1确定。R一是连接在外面在输出和输入中，它是数字，如果我可以通过输出连接来确定，是通过外部连接，你可以改变。更换放大器再来一次，对吧？

So you can settle there like the R one to like two K or three K. So you will change the amplifier gain to the2,000 or 3,000, because this is control is not that something are fixed inside this amplifier As a reason we want this inside ab to be infinity, alsoHerethis means this gives us the freedom to devise our own amplifierThis is an inverted amplifier We can have this non inverting amplifier We connect to the plus You can see that in where is the beginning is connected to the- to the inverting input.  This will give us the inverted amplifier. But next we're connecting the input to the non emerging point to the plus sign here We'll see it will give us this non inviting about emerging output also following the same idea.

所以你可以把R 1设置为2K或3K。所以你可以把放大器增益改为2000或3000，因为这是控制不是在这个放大器里面固定的东西。作为我们想要这个的理由。内AB为无穷大，也这里这意味着这给了我们设计自己的自由。放大器这是一个反相放大器。我们可以用这个同相放大器我们连接到插头你可以看到，在哪里开始是连接到-至反相输入端。这将为我们提供反相放大器。但接下来，我们将把输入连接到非出射点和这里的加号。我们会看到它会给我们这个不吸引人的关于新兴产出也遵循同样的思路。

Right? You're reading these two, but they have the same inputSo we say that is AA business is beingAt this., there is also being the voltage are the Q input have the same voltage levelThis point is also being and this V out is here. And so we say that the V out minus V in, right Difference over R two equals to the reading-0, because this is connected to the ground right over are wrongRightIf we are simplified, we'll see that the V out equals true, right This is R two over R one plus one being here. Now, the ratio with the amplifier ratio is that V out over V equals to one plus R two over R one If we certainly like previously, R two is one, kokr one is one Now, the ratio it will beI'm sorry about it really Because this article one is a much larger than one, because sometimes you just neglect this one hereBecause sometimes this is like R two over R one equals to ten to the power of five It's like a 100,000. So if you still+1, so it's like too much difference to the results.  Sometimes we just say the amplifier gain is R two over R oneBecause the thing is that the here we have this watching, right? The amplifier gain is part 1211But they areIf you come to this side it's the have come to here, right? So it's still article 11, but it's a minus. So this is an inverting amplifier, but here is a non emerging amplifier because it didn't change the sun or output

对的？你在看书这两个，但他们有相同的输入所以我们说AA业务正在进行。在这个.，也有存在电压为Q输入具有相同的电压水平这个点也是存在的，这个V出在这里。所以我们说V输出减去V输入，对吗？R2上的差等于读数-0，因为这是直接接地的都是错的对的如果我们简化一下，我们会看到V输出等于真，对吧？这是R 2/R 1+1, 在这里。现在，与放大器比率的比率是V OUT/V等于1加上R2/R1。如果我们像以前一样，R 2是1，Kokr 1是1现在，它的比例将是我真的很抱歉。因为这篇文章比第一篇大得多，因为有时你会忽略这一篇。因为有时候这是就像R2除以R1等于10的5次方它就像一个100,000.所以如果你仍然+1，就像结果相差太大。有时我们只说放大器增益为R2/R1因为问题是我们这里有这个看着，对吧？放大器增益是部分1211但他们是如果你来到这边这是已经来到这里了，对吗？所以它仍然是第11条，但它是一个减号。这是一个反相放大器，但这里是一个非新兴放大器，因为它没有改变太阳或输出。

After we are having this simple and the rest of the city working and non invertingI think now you can try towe're gonna try and look at this one, which is called summing amplifier You can still see the V plusB minus. And we have also some other outside can X One thing is that the V plus that is zero, because it's connected to grounds the same here at this V zeroThis point here is also zeroThat gives us this one here is also zero. We are always zero.  You can try to calculate the total current a I, too We don't have theas we mentioned before, right It's a current because there is no current into the input

在我们有了这个简单的城市的其他地方都在工作，而且不会逆转。我想现在你可以试着我们来看看这个，它叫做求和放大器。你仍然可以看到V PlusB减。我们也有一些其他的外部可以X一件事是V+是零，因为它连接到相同的地，在这个V 0处。这里的点也是零。这给了我们这里的这个也是零。我们永远是零。你可以试着计算总电流。A, 我也是我们没有就像我们之前提到的，对吧？它是一种电流，因为没有电流。到输入中

You can see there is no in the current here, I equals to zero,  cause you can only consider like this path and this pathThere is another kind of here is these three paths connected converged to the iTunes. So you can try to derive these equations of the USC. The finally is the output It's a sum of these three inputs,  the divider ratio, not two over R one, AR one brcr two is hereLa is the resistance you connected to each input Sometimes maybe you want to highlight the input of a.  You make it this one smaller. Maybe that's the larger that's going to grow in large V in the a input This is something you can change, right?  It's ryrbrc. You can change the amplitude of the resistance Here, as we say, skating or skating is this R two over ry.

你可以看到这里没有电流，I等于零，因为你只能考虑这条路径和这条路径。还有一个这里有三条路径。连接并聚合到iTunes。所以你可以试着推导USC的这些方程。最后是输出它是这三个输入的总和，分频比，不是2/R1，是R1，这里是BRCR2LA是连接到每个输入的电阻有时你可能想突出显示A的输入。你把这个弄小点。也许这是在A输入中的大V中增长的较大值。这是你可以改变的，对吧？它是RYRBRC。您可以更改电阻的振幅在这里，正如我们所说，滑冰或溜冰是这样的。R二超过RY。

It's like how much times you want to enlarge in the ABC inputs. So scanning can be controlled by ratios over resistors This is actual work, ra or tormbOur food is a skilled, some of the booksQuite this can be less than two to populate. So analyzing these circuits,  you need to use the cure of current law. So the summing of the IQ equal to the sound of all of these are currents Nothing is that the I thinkand vs, right, is that the what do you connect here? Is this a minus signThis is an inverted input I do not.  You will see the V RS because I have a minus sign here. So it's changing its direction, changing the sideThat's because you connect to them minus sign or not hand if you change it to the plusRight?

就像多少钱要在ABC输入中放大的次数。因此，扫描可以通过电阻上的比率来控制这是实际工作，RA或TORMB我们的菜是有技巧的，有些书。相当于这个可以少于两个来填充。所以分析这些电路，你需要使用电流定律。所以IQ的总和等于所有这些电流的声音没什么，那是我认为和VS，对，是你在这里连接什么？这是负号吗？这是一个倒置的输入我没有。你会看到VRS，因为这里有一个负号。所以它改变了方向，改变了侧面。那是因为你和他们有联系。减号或不是手，如果你把它改成加号对的？

As we do to this one here, if you put in, can connect the input to this side. And you you can try to designed the circuit by yourself. And I think finally you will have this non inverting summing amplifier. And because now it's an inverted of course, it's not just directly market there because we still might need, you can explore by yourself whether you need to change the structure That's the one integrating amplifier.  This is using this capacity, the capacitor connected across the input and output with the recap of this professor you and I the voltage and the kind of relation is that the current pass throughthere's a capacitor equal to three times derivative of the current, all of the mortgageQuite. So this is the property of the capacitor.  We can integrate this equation If we integrate here it's the integrate of the comments equals to C times U.

就像我们一样到这里的这个，如果你放进去，可以把输入连接到这边。你呢你可以试着自己设计的电路。我想你最终会得到这个的。同相求和放大器。因为现在它是倒置的当然，这不仅仅是直接的市场在那里，因为我们仍然可能需要，你可以自己探索是否需要改变结构。那是一个积分放大器。这是用这个。容量，连接的电容器跨输入和输出随着这位教授的重述你和我的电压和种类的关系那是电流通过有一个等于三倍导数的电容的目前，所有的抵押贷款相当。所以这是的属性电容器。我们可以积分这个方程。如果我们在这里整合它是评论的整合等于C乘以U。

Right? So this is a. How is the voltage We can just rearrange it to the question here. So you, because one of AC in to grow of the cards here we can have this integrating amplifier.  We can still, what we use is still the two relations between the you and I As you+0,  that means you minus is also zero There is no current No,  this current is zero That means the car,  the current will only flow to this line.  What we need to analyze with the the characters characteristics in this one. Okay As we mentioned here, this is zero.  We say the V in-0.

对的？所以这是一个电压怎么样？我们可以重新安排一下。这里的问题。所以你，因为一个AC在成长的卡。在这里，我们可以有这个积分放大器。我们仍然可以，我们使用的仍然是这两个你我之间的关系当你+0时，这意味着你的负数也是零没有电流不，这个电流是零这意味着汽车，电流只会流动到这条线。我们需要分析的是这本书里的人物特点。好的正如我们在这里提到的，这是零。我们说V在-0.

This is here V minus zero over the resistor equals to the current is the current in the capacitor, so we can use it here by a moment it's the minus C DV out over dt We know the DVR is one or minus one rcvdt, and we can integrate it withThat means the difference because this is a time varying because it depends on the time. So the time the voltage change between the T one and T two equals twoThis one here,  this is the integral of the input voltage. Because of this, you can see now the output voltage of the relation has an integral relation with the input voltage.  This is called the integrating amplifier Normally what we use for this integrated amplifier is that we want to because supposing the digital system ok, so we in if a it's like this digital signal, right?

这是这里电阻上的V减0等于电流是电容器中的电流，所以我们可以在这里使用它一会儿它是DT上的负C DV out我们知道DVR是1或负1 RCVDT，我们可以将其与这意味着区别。因为这是随时间变化的，因为它取决于时间。所以电压变化的时间在T1和T2之间等于2。这个，这是输入的积分。电压。因此，您现在可以看到输出关系式的电压与输入电压成积分关系。这称为积分放大器正常地我们使用的对于这个集成放大器，我们希望因为假设数字系统是好的，所以我们在如果它像这个数字信号，对吧？

So we will see immediately see. So during this period, like how much signals pass through, right? Because if we integrate in this part is onefor example, is one. And then there are three policies. So their integration could be three. So it's like counting how much how much policies have the past through this time T one and T two This is integrating amplifier.  If we have integrating all we can have this difference or differentiating amplifier. So that is to replace we change the positions to the capacitorfind the ministerRight? So herethis is resistor in the input voltage here is to the other side and so onCapacitor is in here,  you can try to divide this by yourself.

所以我们马上就会看到。那么在这期间，像多少？信号可以通过，对吧？因为如果我们在这部分积分是一个例如，是一个。然后有三个政策。所以他们的整合可能是三个。所以这就像数多少一样。通过这个时间T1和T2，过去有多少政策？这是积分放大器。如果我们有整合我们所能拥有的一切差分或微分放大器。所以那就是替换我们改变电容器的位置找到部长对的？所以在这里这是电阻器在输入电压中这里是到另一边等等。电容器在这里，你可以试着把它分开由你自己。

This is much simpler compared to the integrated. Because here, what you have is directlythe output is the input, the derivative of the input.  There is a minus sign. This is because you have a connection This is because we have connected the input to the minus a minus input to the inverting input.here you have the minus RC to the different a derivative of the vive Next,  this is kind of the most important amplifier circuit. So it's called the difference amplifier. So it's the view.  The output is proportional to the difference between V in two and V one You can try to analyze this a little bit, okay The current, the voltage level these two are the same,  we say, for this onewho says minus V minus, rightV minus V minus equals two V plus for V plusit's just dividing the voltage.

这就简单多了。与集成的相比。因为在这里，你拥有的是直接的输出是输入，是输入的导数。有一个减号。这是因为你有一个连接这是因为我们已将输入连接到减号负输入到反相输入。这里。你有不同的负RCVive的衍生物接下来，这是最重要的放大电路。所以它被称为差动放大器。所以这是风景。输出与V in 2和V 1之间的差值成正比你可以试着分析一下，好吗？电流，电压水平这两个是一样的，我们说，对于这个谁说负V负，对吧？V减V减等于两个V加对于V+它只是在划分电压。

This is R grg R two plus rg times in two part. So that means the V minus at this point is this rg urge dividing the region two analyzing this circuit above,  because no current inside the amplifier. Right? So we see that V out minus demands over rfbecause the minus V in one over are wrong. You must next. So we can plug in the substitute. OkayV minus into these equations. And then you can simplify. You're trying to simplify it and assumeBut the ratio of thisI want us and I try to understand, so that will give us this is outputThis was rf over R one is equals to the times this difference between the input Now we have this output proportional to the difference between the two inputbecause this one is very kind of usefulfor example,  to the thermal couples, right

这是R GRG, R 2+RG时间分为两部分。所以这意味着在这一点上的V减是这个RG。敦促将该地区分为两个上面分析了这个电路，因为放大器内部没有电流。对的？所以我们看到V出来了减对RF的需求因为负V在一个回合中都是错的你必须下一个。这样我们就可以插入替代品了。好的V减到这些方程中。然后你可以简化。你试图简化它并假设但是这个的比例我想要我们，我试着去理解，所以这会给我们这是输出这是R上的RF，1等于乘以输入之间的差值现在我们有了与两个输入之差成比例的输出因为这个很有用。例如，热电偶，对吗？

If you still remember the thermal couple, so the difference between these two juncturesokay? So it will give usas you the temperature we connect these two output to the difference that requires. So it will directly give us the output These are of this measure to measure the temperature if we use a linear some linear transformation So to the wisdom bridge, right? We can also formulating this circuit here.  You can try to analyze this circuit by yourself to see you actually how it works. Okay I think for the summer couple is a kind of a very intuitive, right For this one, right? Because let's just look at the bridge. So this is like the input.  This is input voltage You can imagine like there is a song or some kind of choice. Byebye

如果你还记得热电偶，那么这两个接合点之间的区别好的？所以它会给我们当你的温度我们连接这两个输出到差异那需要。所以它会直接给我们输出。这些是这个措施来衡量温度如果我们使用线性一些线性变换所以到智慧桥，对吧？我们也可以在这里制定这个电路。你可以试着分析一下这个电路你自己来看看它是如何工作的。好的我觉得对于夏氏夫妇来说是一种很直观的感觉，对吧？为了这个，对吧？因为让我们看看这座桥。所以这是比如输入。这是输入电压你可以想象有一首歌或者某种选择。拜拜

The there are two arms two arms, and this is a device in the middle points.  What we want is a difference between these 2 points, right We can placeThis is true to the to the difference amplifiers. OkayLet's try to analyze it by yourselfHow this is the application of the wisdom bridge and also a similar couple The last thing is that the common mode voltage, because this are just some basic introductory comment. Okay Original voltage, which is common for both inputs, is termed as this common mode voltage.  This is average of these two For example, for the thermal couple, like previously, it's like the output. OkayIs this five for both? Because they are in the same temperature, but they maybe some kind of temperature change to the system Always some noise to a system,  make it as a 5.01.

这个有两只手臂。两个手臂，这是一个装置在中间的点。我们想要的是这两点之间的区别，对吗？我们可以放置这是真的到到差异放大器。好的让我们试着分析一下由你自己这是如何应用智慧桥的，也是一对类似的夫妻。最后一件事是共模电压，因为这只是一些基本的介绍性说明。好的两个输入共用的原始电压称为该共模电压这是这两个的平均值例如，对于热电偶，就像以前一样，它就像输出。好的这五个是两个人的吗？因为它们处于相同的温度，但它们可能会对系统产生某种温度变化。系统总是有一些噪音，将其设置为5.01。

And this is 4.99 calls.  There is some fluctuation in these two inputs But the thing in common is that these two, the sum of these 2 over 2, some of the inputs over two will still be the same.  It's this called like the common base We say there's a common mode, and there's some difference mode.  For the previous example, we have the 5.014.not that much. So the common mode voltage is five the common mode voltage. And there's some difference mode, right?  There are some this is 0.01.  This is something representing the common, which is like the basis and something that is changing,  like the noise or the fluctuation.  This is your point01.  We can write it also as a plus minus ideally, is the difference amplifier will only amplify the potential difference between the two output. And so it's ideally, right? Was it will be the difference here will be0.02 because minus these twoIt will only amplify these two. But in practice, I think the two input channels cannot be perfectly matched,  meaning the base, the basement might have some noise or some other interference. So this vcm will also be amplified like this five here the amplifier whose will not be perfect proportional to the difference of the two inputs

这是4。99个电话。这两个输入有一些波动。但有一点是相同的，这两个，这2除以2的和，一些输入除以2仍然是相同的。它叫这个名字就像共同基地。我们说有一个共同的模式，还有一些不同的模式。对于前面的示例，我们有5.014. 没那么多。因此，共模电压为5共模电压。还有一些不同的模式，对吧？有一些这是0.01。这是代表共同的东西，就像基础和正在变化的东西，就像噪音或波动。这是你的观点。01.我们也可以把它写成一个加减理想情况下，差分放大器将只放大两个输出之间的电位差。所以它是理想情况下，对吧？这里的差异将是0.02，因为减去这两个它只会放大这两个。但在实践中，我认为两个输入通道不能完全匹配，这意味着底座、地下室可能会有一些噪声或其他噪声干扰。所以这个VCM也会像这里的5一样被放大。该放大器与两个输入的差不完全成比例

Let's just see.  One example is like the V in two, the V in one is some base noise.  It's like the base.  If we subtract, ideally, if we and into is the signal plus the noise ideally, is we input to the difference amplifier, right?  The output will give us its original signalBut what we will get is that it will have some have some my noise here.  This is because it has also amplifiedThese are common voltageOkayHere is some definition of thisOutput is ideally,  this is the thing we want, the GD timesDon't be. This is what we want because we want to get the difference, right

让我们看看。一个例子是两个中的V，一个中的V是一些基本噪声。就像基地一样。如果我们减去，理想情况下，如果我们和INTO是信号加噪声理想情况下，我们输入到差动放大器，对吗？输出将给我们它的原始信号但我们将得到的是，它将有一些这里有一些我的噪音。这是因为它也放大了这些是公共电压好的这是对此的一些定义。输出为理想情况下，这是我们想要的东西，GD时代别这样。这是我们想要的，因为我们想要拿到差价，对吧？

But turns out it gives us also this one gcmgcm is the gas for the common mode voltage.  It's the gcm times vcm Like this is 0.01. This is fiveBut they areLuckily, what's lucky is that the gcm is much smaller than the GB. Normally For example, like we have here,  GD, the example here, GD is 4,000 like the and also for the let's look at this example later. So no, ideally, this one G, the gcm case, will be much smaller than the GD. So in this case, the what's high highlighted is still the difference Gd is a gap for the voltage difference. Gcm is, again, for the VCR

但事实证明，它也给了我们一个GCMGCM是共模的气体电压。它是GCM乘以VCM就像这个是0.01。这是五但他们是幸运的是，GCM比GB小得多。正常地例如，就像我们这里的GD，这里的例子，GD是4000人喜欢，也喜欢让我们稍后再看这个例子。所以不，理想情况下，这个G，GCM的情况，将比GD小得多。所以在这种情况下，什么是高突出显示的仍然是差异Gd是电压差的间隙。GCM同样适用于VCR

The common mode voltage,  that's we have introduced a definition called the common mode. Rejection ratio is cmr, is the ratio between the GD of our gcm If there's a share market is large, ok,  if that means this one will be a large, that means the GD is much larger than the T CM This one a 20 log It has another unit called DB It's called like the one dbok is equal to this one The highest cmr is required because the cmr, for typical apologies, are 80 to 100 DB,  like you can find your computer here. So if this20, right GD over gcm equals to like at, let's say that means I wrote the knock of the GD over CCM will be four.

共模电压，我们引入了一个称为共模的定义。拒绝率是CMR，是我们GCM的GD之间的比率如果有一个股票市场很大，好吧，如果这意味着这个将是一个大的，这意味着GD比大得多。T厘米这个是20根木头。它有另一个名为DB的单元它的名字就像DBOK等于这个一样。需要最高的CMR，因为CMR对于典型的抱歉，是80到100分贝，就像你可以在这里找到你的电脑一样。所以如果这个20，对吗？GD/GCM等于AT，这意味着我在CCM上写了GD的敲击声将是四。

So it's a time to the power of four So that means ggd is a 10,000 larger than the gcm. So it means this one, and there will be a more dominant An example here is that the amplifier is, again, GD is 4,000 supplied with the V in one and V in two,  these two, but determining the output voltage if the value of the cmr is distributedOkayAs we have here that we say the V out because GD comes better V, which is agcm times the vcm. So we can subtract thisThey're going to cda time start V out. So this is gcmvcm over is GD dot I.  So is this one cmr. So this is definition of cmr, right It's avcn over V CM over TV. So vcm, right?  As we mentioned, is the average of these two inputs.

所以这是时间的四次方所以这意味着GGD比GCM大10，000。所以它意味着这一个，会有一个更占主导地位的。这里的一个例子是，放大器是，GD是4，000提供V in One和V in Two，这两个，但如果CMR的值是分布式的，则确定输出电压好的正如我们在这里所说的，我们说V出是因为GD比V更好，它是AGCM乘以VCM。所以我们可以减去这个他们要去CDA时间开始了。这是GCMVCM，上面是GD点I。这是CMR。所以这是CMR的定义，对吗AVCN结束了电视上的V CM。那么VCM，对吗？正如我们所提到的，是这两个输入的平均值。

So it's the145, so 145. And third V is the difference between twoIt is ten. And so then they give us, their view is ten V CM average and is 145. And so we can plug in the values inside, get to get the valuesget the results CmrOkay, you need to know it's the ten of the 20 power 5. And we can also give you like the like in this DB form,  like in this one here is the this is 40 yearsThe 40 DB,  this is you need to understand the transformation to the TV and also to the real ratio

所以是145，所以是145。第三个V是两者之间的区别它是十。然后他们给我们，他们的观点是10V cm平均值为145。因此我们可以插入里面的值，得到得到值得到结果CMR, 好的，你需要知道这是20的10次方5。我们也可以给你就像在这个数据库表单中，就像在这个表单中，这里是这是40年。40分贝，这是你需要了解电视和真实比例的转换。
