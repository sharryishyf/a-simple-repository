According to this concept is showing samples about how the processes are under control and what are the basic informations from smart grades.

根据这一概念，展示了关于过程如何受到控制以及来自智能等级的基本信息的示例。

But they apologize. Thank you. I hate itListed generation basishow to calculate, basically fundamentally cultivate that of the generation basis, theoretical power, or any other things, delivery system and consultantsWhy we have our delivery systems? What are the consumption involvedWhat are all rightWhat kind of evaluation indexes we use impulse systems Don't worry too much about that. On the interesting class course work is just any longer designed to make you into trouble is designed to have your trip, get training for the rather amazing comments of this outcomes or expected outcomes of this projectRight?  Let's move on today. And we're going to discuss about the generation pieces. And if possible, we are going to maybe step into a big part of the delivery system Let's have a 15 review of policies and structure If we divide the policies and structures into three categoriesdo I have our generation delivery and customers? But remember one thing in the standard of politics. It also has been divided into transmission. And distribution systems Distribution systems and transmission systems made the deliberation 4 generationsFor example, sure, in this paper, we might have a turbine and connected the generator and create or produce electricity to the power line Normallythe output power or the output voltage for the generator is normally 11 TVThe one, if we wantthe power or the energy could be delivered to a very far distance, for example, that today that will want the renewable energy from the very, very eastern part of China We need to, as we knowincrease the voltage We have the first transformer hereimportant thingsThe step up transport lonely when I was working in the industry, the harder power plant indeed directly converts the Italian pv into 500, kiddingOr sometimes if the pulse generation of power plants is not that big enoughIt reminded those things to possibly you are into from 100 years ago

但是他们道歉。谢谢。我讨厌它列出的生成基础如何计算，基本上从根本上培养了生成基础，理论力量，或其他任何东西，交付系统和顾问。为什么我们有我们的运输系统？涉及哪些消费？什么是好的？什么样的评估指标我们使用脉冲系统别太担心那个。在有趣的课堂上，课业就是正义。任何让你陷入麻烦的设计都是为了让你旅行，得到训练。为了相当惊人对本成果或本项目预期成果的评价对的？今天让我们继续。我们将讨论关于代的片段。如果可能的话，我们可能会进入交付系统的很大一部分。让我们有一个15.政策和结构审查如果我们把政策和结构分为三类我有我们这一代的交付和客户吗？但是记住一件事在政治标准中。它也一直是分为传输和配电系统配电系统和输电系统进行了审议4代例如，当然，在这篇论文中，我们可能有一个涡轮机，并连接发电机，并创造或产生电力到电力线。正常地发电机的输出功率或输出电压正常11电视那个人，如果我们想的话。可以输送动力或能量到一个很远的距离，例如，今天会需要可再生能源。从非常，非常中国东部正如我们所知，我们需要增加电压我们这里有第一个变压器重要的事情步进式运输当我在孤独的行业工作时，电厂更难。确实直接转换意大利PV进入500开玩笑或者有时如果发电厂的脉冲发电不是这样。够大了它提醒那些事情是可能的你喜欢从100年前

And ten P vs four 220He is systems the standard, all the voltage levels are used in the China Chinese standard. The different countries will have different standards. For example, in UK, they use 132. That's differentQuite different than the 250 two fifty six seven series bit. So quite differentAnd that where the power or the energy reaches the delivery system and what might go into the high voltage sometimes going to the ultra high voltage, which means 800 or this is for direct. All rightOr we call that the hvdc is a high voltage direct current transmission systems or one of the humi1,000 TVthe hbac systemsHigh voltage alternative current is transmission systemsThese two systemsNow it's very, very selling and use only the houses and very, very not much, for example, as I know that Chinese government is trying to pay a new hydropower station in Tibet Could you imagine how large of that? It's just a the triple size of our extreme Three Gorges triple size.

10个P对4个220他是系统标准，所有的中国标准中使用了电压等级。不同的国家会有不同的标准。例如，在英国，他们使用132那不一样与250完全不同二五六七系列一点。所以很不一样和电力或能量到达输送系统的地方，以及可能进入高压的东西，有时会进入超高压，这意味着800或这是直接的好吧或者我们称之为HVDC是高压直流输电系统还是其中一个胡米1000台电视HBAC系统高压交流输电系统这两个系统现在它非常非常畅销，只使用房子，而且非常非常不多，例如，据我所知，中国政府正试图支付西藏一座新的水电站。你能想象那有多大吗？它只是我们极端的三峡的三倍大小。三倍尺寸。

So normally it could maybe supply the power for nearly a small provinceFor example, I agree with youSo at that time we don't want that power goes into Brazil or Chongqing or companies below. They don't have that much customers. So that power stationit's too bad. We'll have orchardhigh voltage transmission system and the ultra high voltage system to a connect that power station to Shanghai based on GuangzhouQuite long distancesThen after the power or the energy rich, maybe If the power are transmitted from P better to Shanghai and when it reach the modern side or Shanghai what goes into a step down as wellBecause as we know that also have voltage things. You have very long panelsvery, very big time panels You can look that kind of things cannot be set up in cities areaWhen it reached thismaybe the margin of the siblings area, it will goes into a step bond transformer to lower the voltage into this at least one we call that the distribution network

所以通常它可以也许为近一个小的提供电力省例如，我同意你的观点。所以在那个时候，我们不希望电力进入巴西或重庆或下面的公司。他们没有那么多顾客。所以那个发电站太糟糕了。我们会有的果园高压输电系统特高压系统以广州为基础，将该电站连接到上海。相当长的距离然后之后力量还是能量？也许是富有如果电力从P更好地输送到上海，当它到达现代的一面还是上海？什么也会导致退步？因为我们知道也有电压的东西。你有很长的面板。非常，非常大的时间面板你可以看到这种东西不能在城市地区建立。当它到达这个也许是兄弟姐妹区域的边际，它会进入一个步进键变压器来降低进入的电压这至少一个我们称之为分销网络。

The distribution networks help us to distribute the high voltage or the very high density energies to minutes and finished with customersFor distribution networks, it also have high voltage to the networks and via voltage distribution network. And no voltage distribution effort.  Why do we have this final threeSometimes when we know that if we're from our system we are also customers, we only use cell phones or some other things and only use 230. So why shouldn't we directly convert from the 100+2 200 30 wordsWhat are the T vs to her?  Why notOf coursewe have quite a lot of different customerscustomers, a lot of us, we also have the industryIndustry customers also have mortalsThe motors might use the voltage levels of 33You have quite a lot of variety of customers and also it comes to another extended story while we were in Chongqing

分销网络帮助我们分销高电压还是非常高密度能量向分钟，并与客户完成对于配电网来说，它也有高电压到电网和经由电压的配电网。和无电压分配工作。为什么我们会有最后三强？有时当我们知道如果我们来自我们的系统我们也是客户，我们只使用手机或其他一些东西，只使用230.所以为什么我们不应该直接转换吗从100+2200, 30, 文字对她来说T是什么？为什么不当然我们有很多不同的客户。客户，我们很多，我们也有这个行业。行业客户也有凡人马达可能会使用33的电压电平你有很多各种各样的客户，而且当我们在重庆的时候，它涉及到另一个延伸的故事。

So some customers, particularly for electronic companiesthey try to negotiate with policy with our state grid and connected to the million voltage and high voltage substations. The reason is that it's the reason for doing that is to protect the factory from harmonicsThis kind of harmonics are, if you take it electronic do courses and maybe their lectures there should discuss about that. How about it will be sometimes like a triple or face or 7th times frequency of the originalI said it's a current or voltage signals If you can define it as knowledge, but harmonics will totally destroy the production or verifying electronic devicesThe one where is in 20 that will be what's up one time. And as we know that we have Jing dong fang who created the screech Unfortunately, there is one day, there is a harmonics disaster in the policy section

所以有些顾客，特别是对于电子公司来说他们试图与我们国家电网进行政策谈判，并连接到百万电压和高压变电站。原因是这样做的原因是保护工厂免受谐波这种谐波是，如果你把它电子做课程和他们在那里的讲座也许应该讨论这个问题。它有时会像三倍或脸或原始频率的7倍我说的是电流或电压信号。如果你能把它定义为知识，但谐波将完全破坏生产或验证电子设备在20中的那个将是一次什么。正如我们所知，我们有创造了尖叫的景东方。不幸的是，有一天，有一个谐音政策部分的灾难

And costilow follows nearly 2 hours productionSo all of the products from that 2 hours just goes into rush, goes into the rubbish Right nowthe companies or industries, they try to connect it to more high voltage levels and set their own protections against harmonics and other power quality issues That's a realAlso, the reason why the utilization or customers are connected to high voltageEven it's very hot. And then in China, 110 KiwisRight? Let's move on. So goes into our men potential today, generation basisBefore talking about the details, generation makes it. So going to show you a lot. I have a review about last week's way when you are the primary energy sources for policy service. They say the we love it and we have itWe evaluate it because they are under control. We hated it because it proved you are not aware of any environment Right now Or using something similar, very large space in a very close, sometimes close to the in this area to the customers, but sometimes very far from the customers.

科斯蒂洛紧随其后近2小时生产所以这两个小时的所有产品进入拉什，进入垃圾堆马上公司或行业，他们试图将其连接到更高的电压水平，并设置自己的谐波和其他保护电能质量问题那是真的还有，原因用户或客户连接到高电压即使天气很热。然后在中国，110个新西兰人对的？我们继续吧。那么今天进入我们男人的潜力，世代基础在谈论细节之前，Generation Make It。所以会给你看很多。当你是政策服务的主要能源时，我对上周的方式有一个回顾。他们说我们爱它，我们拥有它。我们评估它是因为它们在控制之下。我们讨厌它，因为它证明了你不知道任何环境。马上或者使用类似的东西，非常大。空格在一个非常接近，有时接近的在这方面给客户，但有时离客户很远。

And we have UKWe hate it and we love it again. And hydropower connection isSo how do you follow electricityQuite an interest of very good of the phone, a number of government. But it shows a natural bias Some countries, for example,  and think aboutfor example, you can it did not have that much of hydro sources the one hybrid electricity, but they don't have that kind of sources. So these files are from there on circumstances and wind, solarAnother bias, am I going against distinct herewe have discussed very much about where we have quite a lot of wind the manufacturer sweeps generation manufacturers pv manufacturers. As I know that the Suzhou only in Suzhou there will be two companies and four to be very big complex for pv systems, but actually TV and the wind system to only account for how much?

而我们有英国我们恨它，我们又爱它。和水电连接是那么如何跟踪电流呢？很好的兴趣的电话，多个政府但是它显示了一种自然的偏见。例如，一些国家，想想例如，您可以它没有那么多的水电资源。一种混合电力，但他们没有那种来源。所以这些文件是从在这种情况下还有风能太阳能另一个偏见，我是不是反对Distinct？在这里我们已经讨论了很多关于我们有相当多的风，制造商席卷发电制造商，光伏制造商。据我所知，苏州仅在苏州就有两家公司和四家公司，非常复杂。对于光伏系统，但实际上电视和风力系统只占多少钱

Byebye5%maybe. So soonFor our electricity useSo not a bias. And they shows, I want to share yourself interesting things. So right now, a lot of students discuss with me about their future career. They said I'm going to maybe work for the for Huawei so or some other advanced technology companies, but that the totalmaybe the total creations on the total value of today's advanced technology companies in the total values is lowerLower manThe tax that's the power system is made for the country Maybe they will be some kind of other bias. That is why are in front of these ones. And we need the headphones, all the things, fire fears. I want to emphasize about BIO fuel sheets because before I went to uki did not hear that much. But when I was in uki goes into travels because they need to solve the rubbish. I don't kind of habits before. So we need to put the our food wasterecycling general waste coupled, and we want to solve the rubbish, the wind, they thoughtOur food waste is trying to convert or stacking them to make by affairsYeah, so today in UK, as I can remember, nearly 5% of the electricity come from BIO fields or come from the rubbishfrom our food waste another environmental protection action. So maybe from today hope you can show their food right through the west airplane and help us to make 5 yearsAll right, justThat's a joke, manAnd come back to the main topic for coal, gas, oil, hydroToday, the most used type of generations are terrible generatorsTurbine generators from the name of this generation, we say, is term I plus generators

拜拜5%, 也许。这么快为了我们的用电所以不是偏见。他们表示，我想分享自己有趣的事情。那么现在，很多学生和我讨论他们未来的职业。他们说我要去。也许为工作。对于华为或者其他一些先进的技术公司来说，总数也许总数创造的全部价值当今先进技术公司的总体价值较低下人税那是为国家制造的电力系统。也许他们会有一些其他的偏见。这就是为什么在这些人面前和我们需要耳机，所有的东西，火灾恐惧。我想强调一下生物燃料板，因为在我去UKI之前，我没有听到太多。但当我是在UKI进入旅行因为他们需要解决垃圾问题。我不要以前的那种习惯。所以我们需要把我们的食物浪费回收一般的垃圾，再加上我们要解决的垃圾，风，他们认为我们的食物垃圾正在尝试转换或者把它们堆起来通过事务使…是的，在我的记忆中，今天在英国几乎5%的电力来自生物场或垃圾。从我们的食物垃圾中又一次环保行动。所以也许从今天开始，希望你能通过西方的飞机展示他们的食物，帮助我们度过5年。好吧只是开个玩笑，伙计。回到煤，天然气，石油，水电的主要话题。今天，最常用的发电类型是可怕的发电机。从这一代涡轮发电机的名称来看，我们说，是术语I。加发电机

I'm sure, in the figure, it is a typically used hydropower plant We have a talk about here. We have a generator on the outside is our conduct by a generator sharp. So when water flows init will push a generator of turbines to rotate then the shaft going to rotate and rotate, and per pull the generators to rotate. When they rotate, the rotor. And the state will have the magnetic reaction to create electricity, powers, or currents in two power systems. This is just a mass structure. We want to have a maybe if we understand the standing that we can click this link after class, I'm not going to show that I think we today America will run out of time too much timeLet's say the first one hydro stations. What are hydro stationsI just agency is trying to choosing to use the color from the up or from maybe from gravity we have an upper poolwe have a lower pool.

我敢肯定，在图中，它是一个典型的水力发电厂。我们在这里谈过了。我们在外面有个发电机。我们的行为是由一个发电机锋利。所以当水流入时它将推动涡轮机的发电机旋转。然后，轴将旋转和旋转，并拉动发电机旋转。当它们旋转时，转子。并且状态将具有磁性反应在两个动力系统中产生电、动力或电流。这只是一个质量结构。我们想有一个可能。如果我们了解立场，我们可以点击这个链接下课后，我不会表现出我认为我们今天，美国将耗尽时间太多时间就说第一个吧。水电站。什么是水电站？我只是代理机构正在尝试选择使用从上或从下的颜色也许是重力造成的我们有一个上层游泳池。我们有一个较低的游泳池。

Normally there will be come here to prevent the water naturally flows into the lower pool. So when we open the gateshere there will be some kinds of gifts when they open the gatethe water will flows down to the term of knowledge. And for the generators to make electricitythen water flow flows into the lower pool One veryVery maybe example of how hydro stations is. We have the pumped hydrocarbons was a very typical more technical is maybe unique example is hydro pumpsstationthis kind of stations are traditional hydropower stations. They sat on rivers This hydro pump the stations. If they are not set on rivers, they are man made stationsWe also giving us a energy storage systems and so for normally, for normal hydropower stations, they set on reverse. So what's influencing to the lower pool? It just flows away, maybe to the sea or from other seats. But for hydro pump stationsThis school is man made You can save water there when this kind of station trying to generate electricity they will for the hydropound,  they were Jews in a water from the upper pool that flows into lower pool.

通常会有。到这儿来为了防止水自然流入下池。所以当我们打开大门这里会有各种各样的礼物。当他们打开大门的时候水会流下来。到知识的术语。和让发电机发电。然后水流流入下池一非常非常可能水电站的示例是。我们有抽水。碳氢化合物是一个非常典型的更具技术性的也许独一无二例如水力泵车站这类电站就是传统的水电站。他们坐在河流上。这个水力泵站。如果它们不是设置在河流上，它们就是人造的车站。我们还给我们提供了储能系统等等。通常，对于正常的水电站，它们设置为反向。那么是什么影响了较低的游泳池？它只是流走了，也许流到了海里，或者从其他座位流走了。但是用于水力泵站这所学校是人造的。你可以在那里节约用水。当这种电站试图发电时，他们将为水力池，他们是犹太人，水从上池流入下池。

But when this station tried to save managingThey were reversely using this generatorThe generator will be set on the mortalAnd the generator will absorb electricity from power systemsretain a model, and reversely, rotate the turmoil. Then absorb the water back to the outputthe same water meter. And until next the day,  when they require electricity, they were going to open the gate. And reverse the function again.  For hydro power stations is a very unique type of hydrogen stations. You have interest,  you can Google some of the things For hydro stations, what are the my characteristics or parameters or indexes that we need to pay attention to 40The crossheadIn industry, this growth has been very importantSurely shall be examples or cases where I wishThen there is a maximum quantity of usable waterincluding meters per second

但当这个电台试图保存管理他们在逆向使用这台发电机。发电机将设置在凡人身上。发电机会。从电力系统吸收电力保留一个模型，反过来，旋转混乱。然后把水吸回去。到输出同样的水表。直到第二天，当他们需要电的时候，他们才会打开大门。和再次反转功能。水力发电站是一种非常独特的加氢站类型。如果你有兴趣，你可以谷歌一些东西。对于水电站，什么是我需要关注的特点或者参数或者指标。40, 十字头在工业中，这种增长非常重要。肯定会是我希望的例子或案例。然后是可用水的最大量。包括米每秒

These trees are being poured into 17So why I said the postcard is very important that here comes the question that would be waters 400 stationsIs it really, always possible to create generated electricity when water flows down Only when the grass had is a proper create a ProAll right, maybe on the way it's Super Bowl, maybeAnd then a simple oneWhen we went across cat is a suitable While worse, how does that can remember? We were working in the hydropower station that would be one timeIn summer, as we know that summer, they have quite rainfall, so they have storms, they have floodThe risethe level of the operaof the lower poolMaybe I didn't have another commentThe risethe level of the lower court from the maybe the average scenarios to a maximum at that timethe crossheadReduced That's kind of crosshead did not have that much of mechanical power to push the 12 months later only when the crosshead is appropriate over the power station cannot generate electricity.

这些树正在被注入17所以为什么我说明信片很重要问题来了。那就是沃特斯。400个车站当水流下来的时候，真的总是有可能产生电力吗？只有当小草是一个适当的创建一个Pro好吧，也许在路上，也许是超级碗。然后是一个简单的当我们经过时，猫是一个合适的更糟糕的是，那怎么能记住呢？我们在水电站工作，那将是一次在夏天，正如我们所知，夏天降雨量很大，所以会有暴风雨，会有洪水。崛起水平歌剧的下池的也许我没有其他的评论。崛起下级法院的级别从也许是平均水平场景到最大限度那个时候十字头减少了那是一种十字头没有那么大的机械动力来推动。12个月后仅当十字头合适时完毕电站不能发电。

This kind of scenarios also applies to win the power stations If you have seen winter much, it's rotatingBut it also can only worse when the wind speed is appropriate, wind speed to know no electricity will be too highNo, it interestingThat's very similar scenarios. So now, how do you calculate the power? How to put it for the hydro stationTheoreticallystill, I'm not sure I take away. This is a physical equationsSo that's radical gross powerIt's given by these equationsHe goes boring thingsRole is a unit weight of water, but to make you a relief, don't worry about these kind of equations for this kind of very basic physical equations. I will just they gave you your exam, so don't worry about that. So these are physically creations. I call it very boring things to engineering It's well only the unit weight of water.  Let me read it.  Q is a maximum quantity of beautiful water and G is acceleration of gravity.  That HP is a four across hats,  blah, blahBut what we are going to pay attention to are the engineerPb is very, very theoretically calculated what we are going to pay attention to lossesWe have quite a lot of corporations in converting the hydropower stations into electricity. So what's the loss and to join in red color, as you can seeFriction when water flows through the two until the turbinesjust us all waters flows on adding surfaceYou have frictionIt will cause friction losses We could might converts the original gross head. This gross head is mathematically calculated. But if we consider the fictionwe will have another index important thingsThe effective hate they useful hate for usThen another onewe want to try to push no turbines to rotate another losses, another loss, and my kind the technicalWe call that the hydraulic power

这种情况也适用于赢得发电站。如果你经常看到冬天，它在旋转。但它也只能在风速合适的时候更糟，要知道风速不会太高。不，这很有趣这是非常相似的场景。那么现在，你如何计算功率？水电站怎么放？理论上尽管如此，我还是不确定我是否能带走。这是一个物理方程。所以这是激进的总权力。它是由这些方程给出的他喜欢无聊的事情。角色是水的单位重量，但为了让你放心，不要担心这些非常基本的物理方程。我会只是他们给你考试了，所以不用担心。所以这些都是身体上的创造。我把它称为非常无聊的工程。这只是水的单位重量。让我读一下。Q是美丽水的最大量，G是重力加速度。那个惠普是四个交叉的帽子，等等等等。但我们要关注的是工程师Pb是非常非常理论化的计算。我们要注意的是亏损。我们有很多公司。将水电站转化为电力。那么损失是什么，加入红色，正如你所看到的。摩擦当水流经过两个涡轮时只有我们所有的水都在增加表面上流动。你有摩擦它会造成摩擦损失。我们可能会转换原始数据毛头。这个总水头是用数学方法计算出来的。但如果我们考虑到小说我们将有另一个索引重要的东西。有效的憎恶他们对我们有用的仇恨。然后再来一个我们想试着推。没有要旋转的涡轮机另一个损失，另一个损失，和我的同类技术我们称之为液压动力。

Are they suppose if we convert this PP herewe might have another one. So sorry, it's aphpH, the hydrogen power. That's maybe drops out the friction losses, thenfor the turbine, when it reached upon turbine to have PT who are covered to find power considers it was efficiency of the turbine menWe have the real PG We can call it P for PT when they generate to try to make lectures and even the generator is very efficient todayit is still have the efficiency issues PG Consider the efficiency so that if we connected togetherit would be PG equals two efficiency of the generator trying to PT retail buy and equals efficiency generator,  it should be here. YeahThat's right. AgainPlus PT times the efficiency of turbine that equals to efficiency of the generator times efficiency of the turbine times the efficiency of theHi, John, hi, Johnny systems times the realityDoes it have theoreticalSorry,  if we collected all the efficiency values or indexes togetherwe got our finalthe activities electrician electricity powered

他们假设如果我们在这里转换这个PP我们可能有另一个。那么对不起，是APHpH，氢动力。那是也许可以去掉摩擦损失。对于涡轮机，当它到达涡轮机时，具有PT谁被覆盖了寻找力量考虑它是汽轮机效率男人我们有真正的PG。我们可以叫它P。对于PT当他们尝试制作讲座时，即使是今天的发电机也非常高效。它仍然存在效率问题。PG, 考虑到效率，如果我们连接在一起它会是PG等于2发电机效率试着PT零售购买和等于效率发电机，应该在这里。是啊对的。又普勒斯角时代水轮机效率那等于发电机效率时代汽轮机效率时代的效率嗨，约翰，嗨，强尼系统。时代现实它有理论上的对不起，如果我们把所有的效率值或指数收集在一起我们拿到了期末考试。活动电工电力驱动

Let us have a unique example to help understand what's happening I have a problem with that output of that output. Remember? Thanks. PptWorking of 100 megawatts and brass hadThis is the grassKoss headphones have been 500 meters also have the following efficiency Row is geared to, you live in the genius for gravity. It's calculated about the turbine and hydrogen power and also effective head and abdominal water flowsAnd how to determine the diameter of the circularSee, the gallery is optimal. Water speed is 4 meters per second in the firstThat's the first oneSo turbine and hydropowerif we calculated in the forward way that we need to calculate about the Top very Top points, the PbIf we have apvwe can times the efficiency of the hydro stations high. Hydraulic efficiency, we will have the turbine power. And every time the turbine efficiency will have the turbine power, but we don't have that much information because Q is unknown How come we doWe, reversely calculated because we have PNow, there's att out of the TTWe know that PG is 100 teacher, the equals to these two equations If we convert it, we have PT, the terminal high one should be equals to P divided by the efficiency. How many actions you have to of the generationThen for pHthe hygienic compiler, you should equals to the power of the last power of the generator divided by the efficiency of the pulse, the generators, and the efficiency of the turbine systems. LogicalNext onethe effective head and the normal water floweffective hat Is it equals to the crosshead times the efficiency of the hydraulic system? Wellnot difficultEven compactedAnd the longing of water flowQQ If we have Hwe could calculate it just converts equations is they are not very difficult

让我们有一个独特的例子，以帮助了解发生了什么的输出有问题那个输出。记得谢谢PPT, 工作100兆瓦，黄铜有这是草地。Koss耳机已经500米还具有以下效率行是适合，你住在重力的天才。它是关于涡轮机和氢动力的计算。以及有效的头部和腹部水流。如何确定圆形的直径看，画廊是最理想的。第一阶段的水速是每秒4米。这是第一个。所以涡轮机和水电如果我们正向计算我们需要计算一下顶部非常高的分数，Pb如果我们有APV我们可以时代水电站的效率很高。水力效率，我们将有涡轮动力。每次涡轮效率都会有涡轮功率，但我们没有那么多信息。因为Q是未知的我们怎么会这样？我们，反过来计算是因为我们有P现在，TT中有ATT我们知道PG是100老师，等于这两个方程如果我们转换它，我们有PT，终端高1应该等于P除以效率。有多少行动你必须是一代人。然后是pH值卫生编译器，你应该等于发电机最后一次发电的功率除以脉冲效率、发电机效率和涡轮系统效率合乎逻辑下一个有效水头和正常流量有效帽子它等于十字头时间吗液压系统的效率？好吧不难甚至被压实还有水流的渴望。QQ, 如果我们有H我们可以计算一下转换方程是因为它们不是很难。

And try to really any questions about that?  You can have any questions about the calculation steps again with your handAnd okay, so 27.2 cubic meters per 7. Right The third one where increase extra knowledge how to calculate the diameter of the circular field gallery The two from if you move backplease persuade if we really try to turn it from the bottom sideIt should be like a circleIt's not a cooking and it's not a rectangle or some other things. It's a circleSo the third question aims to find out the diametersAll this circle If you're trying to find a diameter of the circle, that will be another extra knowledge authority, the flu rate equationsthe flow rate of the water flows, specific type diameter called the discharge equation. The Q is the flow rate that we have this derived a question B.

对此有什么问题吗？你可以用你的手再次对计算步骤有任何疑问。和好的，那么27.2, 立方米每 7, 对的增加的第三个额外的知识圆形场坑道的直径如何计算那两个从如果你搬回来。请劝如果我们真的试着从底部转动它。它应该像一个圆圈。这不是烹饪，也不是长方形或者其他的东西。它是一个圆圈所以第三个问题旨在找出直径所有这些圆圈如果你试图找到圆的直径，那将是另一个额外的知识权威，流感率方程。水流的流速，具体类型直径称为流量方程。Q是我们得到的流速。导出一个问题B。

The a is a flow area. V is a velocityconsidering a cross section of the 5th gallery, sirIt's a cycle. So this our mathematics that's it should be learned in field school The flow area to be converted here ensure the equals to Q divided by mean, we hope actually, we have all the variablesSo finally, the diameters can be directly controversial Any questions about this examplesI don't think it will be difficult. So that's the oneThe next kind of why do they apply it? Or the I could define it as the most like deployed systems, steam power plantand do not call it as a fossil fuel or coal power or some other things because its principle is using steamPreviously the hydropower station using water to push a turbines, but for state power ground is you think no matter it's cool, but it's gas, no matter it's nuclear, the other private energy sources, they're trying to create things using high pressure and low pressure schemes to push itthe systems to rotate for the systems, we have waters flows in and in the children who are converted to thingsesteem will pressure, will push.

A是流动区域。V是速度考虑到第五展厅的横截面，先生这是一个循环。这就是我们的数学。那是应该在野外学校学习的。流动区域要转换在这里确保等于Q除以平均值，我们希望实际上，我们有所有的变量。所以最后，直径可能是有争议的对此有什么问题吗？例子我认为这不会很难。所以就是那个。下一种他们为什么要应用它？或者我可以将其定义为最相似的部署系统，蒸汽发电厂不要把它称为化石燃料或煤电。或者其他一些事情因为其原理是利用蒸汽以前的水电站是用水来推动一台水轮机，但用于国家地面发电是你想的。不管它很酷，但它是天然气，不管它是核能，还是其他私人能源，他们都试图用高压和低压方案来推动它。要旋转的系统对于系统，我们有水流入和在皈依事物的孩子们身上自尊会施压，会推动。

This is a low pressure tumble and the high pressure humblethese two chambers will work together. There will be 2 times in They are working on essential to rotate the generators from electricity Could you remember that,  for instance, I give you a question about why we are using 50 hertz until todayIs it because most of our generators are like this sizeAnd the efficientefficient and safe speedrotating speed of this kind of generators is a 3,000 or 3,060 It also different standard for different countriesThese two valuesAnd at these values, it converts to electricityIt equals 50 hertz. Another reason has no extra handsWe want efficiency, we want this kind of power plants could work Actuallythis kind of steam power plants could be divided into three cycles on next page Three cyclesThe airfear and forecast Sorry. It is looking this cycle. And water to singing, recycle another cycles besides is the cooling water.

这是低气压。翻滚和高压谦卑这两个分庭将共同工作。将有2次他们正在研究基本的用电来转动发电机你能记住，例如，我给你一个关于为什么我们使用50赫兹的问题吗？直到今天是不是因为我们大多数发电机都是这种尺寸的？还有高效的高效安全速度这种发电机的转速为3000或3,060, 不同国家也有不同的标准。这两个值在这些值下，它会转化为电能。它等于50赫兹。另一个原因没有多余的手。我们想要效率，我们想要这种发电厂可以工作。其实这种蒸汽动力装置可分为三个循环（下页）。三个周期空气恐惧和预报抱歉它正在寻找这个周期和水去唱歌，循环利用另一个周期此外还有冷却水。

Condensercurling water circuits, current water circuit, the details is showing on the exercise. So different signals have these different functionsWhile water flows in interesting generatorssteam goes into push her mind. And ashes outactually, sometimes from coal or maybe guessBecause gas will also have some toxic gas that we need to absorb itto try to not relieve it or emitted into the environment. And if you're in dash dash out, air creator, exhaust systems, exhausted gas This is from hereL L feel through gas is not that important, but it's only for the coal power plantSo for late nuclear power plant, anything changes, which I have feelingNuclear power plants can have nuclear reactions to hit the water. Then.  Yeah, goodIf you guess is not here ash extractor is required for coal fired power, scissors to for environment protectionSo that is the reason that's why our environment is into a 40 day

冷凝器冰壶水电路，目前的水电路，细节显示在演习上。那么不同的信号具有这些不同的功能当水在有趣的发电机中流动时蒸汽进入推动她的思想和灰烬实际上，有时来自煤炭。或也许猜一下因为气体也会有一些有毒气体，我们需要吸收它。尽量不将其释放或排放到环境中。如果你加入了破折号，破折号，空气发生器，排气系统，废气这是从这里。我觉得天然气并不是那么重要，但它只适用于燃煤电厂所以对于后期的核电站，有什么变化吗？我有感觉核电站可以发生核反应撞击水面。然后嗯，很好如果你猜不是这里燃煤发电需要排灰机，剪刀为了环境保护所以这就是为什么我们的环境进入40天的原因。

So sometimes they do not open the as extractorIn reality, when particularly at nightthe closingbecause it's kind of like a chemical reaction for this part and any articles or any actions to be connectedThey need to pay for the costThat is also the reason why you get out very bad atmosphere and ears today. That what a spin cycles? What about it? What's the thingCycles, actually, the pressure is not the normal pressureThey try to reduce the pressureBecause when pressure reduce the temperaturethis yellow box, yellow linethe temperature to convert water into steam or recorder. It's as a preparation reactionthe temperature for the recreation reactions decreaseDo we want to rarely to increase the temperature for cooling for? What is the inside of the world? Do you really wonder what it into a very high temperature actually notWe want to save energyIf we try to just don't do something in the pressure partsThe energy or the efficiency could be increased because we can easily convert water into steam

所以有时他们不打开作为提取器实际上，尤其是在晚上闭幕因为它有点像化学反应，因为这个部分和任何文章或任何行动都有联系。他们需要支付费用。这也是你今天走出非常糟糕的氛围和耳朵的原因。那个多好的旋转周期啊那又怎么样那是什么东西？实际上，压力不是正常压力他们试图减少压力。因为当压力降低时温度这个黄色的盒子，黄色的线将水转化为蒸汽的温度或录音机。这是一种准备。反应再创造反应的温度降低我们想很少提高冷却温度？世界的内部是什么？你真的想知道它的温度到底有多高吗？我们要节约能源。如果我们试着只是不要在压力部分做什么。能量或效率可以增加，因为我们可以很容易地转换水变成蒸汽

Do you think blacks? How are youThen the cooling water figuresthe only one in a second is also another very evidence that we need to do some magic for the pressure thingsfor cooling watersfor this kind of steam generators It will have a pattern here a waters out a line is connected with response so far connected to the motorcyclesKind of right again. I'm sorry, it's been this cooling water. This line is connected from the condenser and we need to India more waters name to support us to reduce the temperature of the waterAnd to convert the gas to liquid again.  Why should we cover the gas to liquid againWe want, actually, is this kind of problem is called steampowerpoint Where is the energy comes fromIt comes from burningIt hit then safe energy in steam We want a thing could save us much as energy as possible so that you could push the turbines using the full power

你认为黑人你好吗那么冷却水的数字一秒钟的唯一也是另一个非常明显的证据是，我们需要为压力做一些神奇的事情。用于冷却水对于这种蒸汽发电机它在这里会有一个模式。一场水战A, 线路与连接响应目前为止连接到摩托车上又对了。对不起，这是这些冷却水。这条线是从冷凝器接出来的，我们需要印度更多的水域名称支持我们降低水温。和来转换气体再次转化为液体。为什么要把气体变液体再覆盖一遍？我们想要的，其实就是这种叫做蒸汽的问题。PowerPoint, 能量从哪里来？它来自燃烧。它击中了那么蒸汽中的安全能量我们想要的东西可以节省我们尽可能多的能源。这样你就可以推动涡轮机使用全功率

But let's see the stageIf water or liquids stays in the sand states, for example, as liquid or as gas Entropy, we could deal, if you do not know the definition of entropy, could be just the same as all the energy The heat energy can be hereIf it's adequatethe energy or entropy you could save is quite smallAnd alsoit means gasIt's also very small, but when water can't aim to guess fishingAnd we continue the entropy. It could see it is enormousAnd also when but this kind of scenario. And so this who wants to build another chance. So the energy could save is enormous.  We want the back of water into the before it goes back to the steam generators. All right, now actually, we want water backs into steam generators, but not sting back to the skin generallyOne of the same committeeSingapore energy theoryBut this kind of scenarios make another trouble is because sometimes stains closing to the condenser which means we need more energy or energy scenarios to cooling down the things into water

但是让我们看看舞台。如果水或液体留在沙子里。状态，例如，液态或气态熵，我们可以处理，如果你不知道熵的定义，可以和所有的能量一样。热能可以在这里。如果足够的话你可以节省的能量或熵是相当小的。还有它的意思是气体它也很小，但是当水不能以猜测为目的捕鱼我们继续熵。它可以看到它是巨大的。还有什么时候但这种情况。所以这个谁想再创造一次机会。那么可以节省的能源是巨大的。我们想要后面的水变成了在它回到蒸汽发生器之前。好了，现在实际上我们想要水回流到蒸汽发生器，但一般不会刺痛皮肤同一个委员会的成员新加坡能源理论但是这种场景制造了另一个麻烦，因为有时污点关闭到冷凝器这意味着我们需要更多的能源或能源方案。把这些东西冷却成水

I see that if the cooling water heating is profits in 78, 10°for this example, if we try to calling down the water from 20 five, sometimes I also think~15:00 degreesThe cooling water quantity is about 50 to 70 times of the same weightAnd these makes another travel as a river temperature should on riseBecause folks think our problemthe cooling world, some is directly rejected from the river If the river is not big enoughthe river temperature will increase quite a lot Not good for our environmentThat is also the reason that large steam power plant or nuclear power plantthey are normally set at the seaside or are very, very close to Yangtze River bridge or very big bridgeYou want to unstoppable, consistent, fresh water in particularly for nuclearThe nuclear power plant it when it started never stopWe always use the fresh waters from the sea to cooling down the systems

我看到了如果冷却水加热是78中的利润，10°在这个例子中，如果我们尝试从20开始向下调用水五、有时我也会想~15:00, 度冷却水量约为50到70相同重量的倍数还有这些进行另一次旅行因为河流的温度应该上升。因为人们认为我们的问题冷却的世界，有些是直接的从河中被拒绝如果河流不够大河水温度会升高很多。对我们的环境不好。这也是为什么大型蒸汽发电厂或核电厂它们通常设置在海边，或者非常非常靠近长江大桥或非常大的桥。你想要不可阻挡的，一致的，淡水特别是核能核电站在它启动时从未停止过。我们总是使用来自海洋的淡水来冷却系统。

Right?  This is also another reason that if you watch the videos about the Fukushima, all about the 200 by disasters, you say that reduce they tried to use sea waters and that is also the reason why they ejected quite a lot of stupidity waters into the sea today to cooling down the system It's only 10°But if could you imagine that how many of the calling what they usually want to use? Ten eighty°, 100°, 200°What are you from Abraham Just the principles, because II don't set any outcomes for the steam power plant populations because it involves quite a lot of complex the reactions that would be too difficult for you. But if you have interest, you can try to maybe read the push eyesmemory in the handbook. It shows a population steps about how to converts from the fossil fuels to the that output of the power plant And so on We too much, actually, we have 2 kinds

对的？这也是另一个原因，如果你看关于福岛的视频，所有关于200由灾难，你说减少他们试图用海水和这也是为什么他们驱逐了相当多的愚蠢。今日入海之水冷却系统只有10度但如果你能想象一下，有多少人在打电话，他们通常想用什么？十个80°，100°，200°你是亚伯拉罕的什么人？只是原则，因为我不会为蒸汽发电厂的人口设定任何结果，因为它涉及相当多的复杂的反应对你来说太难了。但如果你有兴趣，你可以试着读推眼手册中的记忆。它展示了如何将化石燃料转化为发电厂的输出的人口步骤。如此等等我们太多了，实际上，我们有两种

Sorry, it's not similar. It should be going into emerging technologies What's going onHow many? Let's have a break. Then we have continued to discuss about the waiter

对不起，不一样。它应该进入新兴技术领域。这是怎么回事多少？让我们休息一下。然后我们继续讨论关于服务员的问题。

03月07日 09时59分


They might actually so if you want to extend the knowledge or maybe if you have interest only through my class, you will get interested in houses and you can read these students and particularly for the handbook of politiciansSo these books actually, you don't need to buy it, don't waste the money It has open, so open access sources on our library. You can directly download your book Ii don't know you from that, right So it's only for both. And if you have any interest you can read about it. It's an 81 have more informations about history, about it today, about the futureAll right, let's continue for wind turbinesparticularly what we can see in our daily life is that we call the traditional internet Have a plate, three plate and rotate in the sky Seems very bigBut for distributed when winter might actually, we have this one, the multiple access spiral too much

如果你想扩展知识，或者如果你只对我的课感兴趣，你会对房子感兴趣，你可以阅读这些。学生，特别是政治家手册所以这些书其实你不需要买，不要浪费钱。它是开放的，所以我们图书馆的资源是开放的。你可以直接下载你的书。我不认识你，对吧所以它只适用于两者。如果你有任何兴趣，你可以阅读它。这是一个81有更多关于历史，关于它的今天，关于未来的信息。好吧，我们继续用于风力涡轮机尤其是我们在日常生活中所看到的。我们称之为传统互联网。有一个板块，三个板块在天空中旋转。看起来很大但是对于分布式的冬天，我们有这个，多路访问。螺旋形太多了

Actually, when I was in uki tried to buy one Paris and the center in my backyard of my house. But my label just excuse me, for making noise there. So I was refused to set up this winter by see my backyardI it really make noises. The working noise is 30 to 75. Babies such as thatMaybe if they were at the same time, you cannot find the feeling now. But if it's like that time, when you're asleep, you'll find it's making the right and just but if you have this opportunity, if you have a house in China, you can try to maybe make one or is it can consistently generate electricity and the right to the power of the houseRight Calculators or windAnd also don't worry about this or physical equations. I will give all physical equations in your exam involved when we call copyright of our winter linesthe power of wind turbine and consider it's quite similar to the hydropower station, hydropower stations.

实际上，当我在Uki的时候，我想买一个。巴黎和我家后院的中心。但我的标签只是原谅我，在那里制造噪音。那么今年冬天，我看到了我的后院，被拒绝了。它真的会发出声音。工作噪音为30至75宝宝们比如那个也许如果他们在同一时间，你现在找不到感觉。但是如果就像那个时候，当你睡着的时候，你会发现正确公正但如果你有这个机会，如果你在中国有房子，你可以尝试也许做一个，或者它可以持续发电，并有权使用房子的电力。对的计算器或风也不要担心这个或物理方程。我会给出你考试中涉及的所有物理方程。当我们调用我们的冬季系列的版权时风力涡轮机的功率，并认为它与水电站，水电站。

I will use a hydraulic power for winter, but we use the wind power Why don't you think they'll be in power? What kind of parameters it should be involvedFirst oneL massL mass is something like the wind turbine could capture. For example, if I draw it, I'm not very good at joining. So place fail the sparkling things Ls is how much the weather was winterized with rotating the space or the area the wind turbine could captureAs we call the air massNowvelocityfew velocityvelocity In the weakness speed, or we can call it a winner speed.  If you have the L mass and have the velocity, actually, we can easily calculate about the theoretical power of wind turbinesThis is physical equationsnot designed by me I will show it in the exam or if you really want to push you very hard, you can remember that. I don't like to realize it

冬天我会用液压动力，但我们用的是风力。你为什么不认为他们会掌权？什么样的参数？它应该参与。第一个L质量L质量类似于风力涡轮机可以捕获的东西。例如，如果我画它，我不是很擅长加入。那么位置辜负了闪闪发光的东西LS是多少钱通过旋转风力涡轮机可以捕获的空间或区域，天气变得寒冷。我们称之为气团现在速度速度很小速度在弱势速度中，或者我们可以称之为赢家速度。如果你有L质量和速度，实际上，我们可以很容易地计算出关于理论力量风力涡轮机这是物理方程。不是我设计的。我会在考试中表现出来，或者如果你真的想逼你的话。很难，你可以记住。我不想意识到这一点。

For engineering studieswhat is important and how to use these equationsThis equation, as I said, it's theoretical, physical thingssabbatical, and physical sent. It can all make a date to the power generated by the winter light. I deletedBut winter events are set at different altitudeDifferent areasdifferent temperature, environment changes the powerI see. First onebecause environment changes air densityAnd L density changes by temperature and architectureIf you have a temperature changethe L density change10, the original density, T zero indicates the original temperatureAnd the road equals to the acquire adjusted Justin L density These two equationsor are important I will not show that it makes sense Then when only the altitude of the changewhat happens? All you need to change means that the speed on the density also change Density before density adjusted. And temperature again, and the heat differencethe difference of heat that's zero indicates the hate on altitude before an edge indicates the attitude after

用于工程研究什么是重要的以及如何使用这些方程这个方程，正如我所说，它是理论上的，物理上的东西。休假，和物理发送。这一切都可以追溯到冬季阳光产生的能量。我删除了但冬季项目设置在不同的海拔高度。不同的领域不同的温度环境变化力量我明白了第一个因为环境改变了空气密度。和l密度变化温度和建筑如果你有温度变化L密度变化10原始密度，T零表示原始温度而道路等于获取已调整贾斯廷L密度这两个方程或者很重要我不会证明它是有意义的。然后当只有海拔高度的变化发生了什么事？所有你需要改变的意味着密度的速度也会改变。密度调整前的密度和又是温度，又是热度不同热量的差异零表示之前高度上的仇恨，边缘表示之后的姿态。

It's a constant equals to 29.27This number, you don't need to remember. The constant number. I will show you that in the end,  it's out of the assessmentRightWin the speed and different attitude. So attitude also change about wind speedWind speed before in the afternoonaltitude before, altitude after and this efficient all indexIf it's a form, they are seeing the a or bars are should equals to 0.16If it's about playground without obstaclesit will be 0.17~0.2. NoJust a brief introduction to the equations. And let's use the sample. You have to understand thatCalculate the theoretical power per square meter of area for we just belong to the team of 4 meters per second than the 7 meters per second. And the corresponding threat of power with constant with the conditionsair densities0° and normal pressure

它是一个常数等于29.27, 这个号码，你不需要记住。常数。我会告诉你，在最后，它是出于评估对的赢得速度和不同的态度。所以对风速的态度也发生了变化。下午前风速前海拔高度、后海拔高度和这种效率所有索引如果是表格他们在看A或条应等于0.16如果是关于没有障碍的操场它将是0.17~0.2不只是对方程的简单介绍。让我们使用样本。你必须明白这一点。计算理论功率每平方米面积的为了我们只是属于这个团队。每秒4米的速度比每秒7米的速度快。和相应的权力威胁不变有了条件空气密度0°, 和正常压力

So for 0 altitude above the sea the standard pressure, but 20°, what will be less practical powerAnd 2000 and the corresponding pressure and 10°I don't think speed of zero. WhatIn what it will be a spectacle power. For this question, the velocity of heat changes ignored OKFor the third one, assume the above speed values applied to ahead of 10 meter above the groundHow does the power change in percentage if the wind turbine is installed 20 meters above the groundthe L density of hate change is growing. Sometimes you cannot cover everything because air density, temperature, heat, they are collectively changes in physically or simplified calculations. We normally assume some variables to be a certain value and do not changeAs soon as the first onecultivate the surgical power of 20°L density

所以对于 0, 海上高度标准压力但是。20°，什么是不太实用的功率？和2000年以及相应的压力和10°我不认为速度为零。什么在这将是一种壮观的力量。对于这个问题，热变化的速度忽略不计好的对于第三个，假设以上应用于地面以上10米处前方的速度值如果风力涡轮机安装在20米处，功率的百分比如何变化？在地面之上仇恨变化的密度正在增长。有时你不能覆盖所有的东西，因为空气密度，温度，热量，它们都在变化。在物理或简化计算中。我们通常假设一些变量为某一值且不变。一旦第一个培养20°手术力L密度

Firstly, we need to calculate about the air densitythe air density before it's a lower value, and we also have the T zero to be 0°Remember, when you calculate about wind powerstheoretical power, we need to convert it to. Yeah. I can't remember what kind of degreesSyndivision or key deviation There makes 270 three. And we have the new temperature, 20°273 should be divided by 293 We can go to the new L density 1.205 kg plus kilometer 1/2 the element. I think it will help us to easily calculate about the radical power, theoretical power, air density, L mass. We also have L mass.  Sometimesif the question do not set a real number or value for illness, elements could be assumed as oneJust as you may have one, it will be fineThen by having these values one here, and we have the changed and density at20°. And we have the world velocity. We can cook it about the surgical powerbelong to the center

首先，我们需要计算空气密度。在它之前的空气密度是一个较低的值，我们也有T零是0°, 记住，当你计算风力时理论功率，我们需要将其转换为是啊。我不记得了什么样的学位？共分或关键偏差有270个三。和我们有了新的温度，20°273应除以293我们可以去新闻L密度1.205公斤+公里元素的1/2。我认为这将帮助我们很容易地计算出自由基的功率，理论功率，空气密度，质量。我们还有L质量有时如果问题没有设置疾病的实数或实值，则可以假设元素为1就像你可能有一个，它会很好。然后把这些值放在这里，我们就改变了20°时的密度。我们有世界速度。我们可以用手术的力量来烹饪它。属于中心

Only the velocity change to cook it, to have the theoretical power at 7 meters%or 22 thousand meters above the sea level at Christmas pressure and 10° and the wind speed of reasonable. So there are there's no value for thatYou can take it if you see the answersWhen we say that at a wind speed of V zero, but we do I do not give you a real number of V zeroYou can just take the vantage V zero into the answers. Then we find let's see the questions. What changes? Hey, peopleAnd temperature again twoWhere are those changeAt this time, let's do these calculations step by stepWhat is that? What stumbling value sometimes? Because as we know that hate changesAlso connects to temperature changes Let's do something before which one should be calculated beforeTemperatureOr if you collected them together, they would be fine. But to my personal habits, I want to divide it Let's talk a bit about the advance of the changes first stagePreviously we have calculated about the trend on density out20°.

只有速度变化去烹饪它，去拥有理论上的力量7米%或海拔2.2万米在圣诞节压力和10°和合理的风速。所以有那是没有价值的如果你看到答案，你就可以接受。当我们说在风速为零的情况下，但我们没有给出一个实数。你可以把Vantage V Zero带到答案中。然后我们发现让我们看看问题。什么变化嘿，各位和温度二那些零钱在哪里？现在，让我们一步一步地做这些计算。那是什么？有时什么是绊脚石价值？因为我们知道仇恨会改变也连接到温度变化让我们在之前做一些事情，其中一个应该在之前计算温度或者如果你把它们收集在一起，它们就会很好。但是我个人的习惯，我想分一下。让我们谈一谈变革第一阶段的进展。之前我们已经计算了密度向外20°的趋势。

Now, it will be easy to help us to cook it about the air density of the10°And some,  if you say that, could I convert it or can I copy it to the L density for 10°from zero integrationNobody's also fine because previously we also have different degrees with face, row by having the air density as ten emissionLet's calculate about the spectacle power. But 0 meters above the seahave a 0 meters about the seathen we want the theoretical power at 2,000 meters above the sea. We also take that values into the equationsP zero into reality. But rememberbecause if we reversely see this equationsI can say that they will be another temperature here, tea for positive change and also have a team here Actuallythis tea,  if these two I will change itThis T should be because ttuit's not the T zeroIt's a temperature art Probably all the objective attitude. So for this questionthis T is T 10°Also, you can seecould I maybe change a sequence? Could I change just calculate the row ten10°, and then row10° In 2000I'm asl that may also fine because she is only conversions for equationsFor these examples, I calculated the P zero, then times efficiency E or the change equations. But actually, it's the same thing. It is a lot. If you try to expand this quite this equation, it equals to 200 a. And roadTennessee times this E, what is which is zeroat save times fixtureThe zero should be adding habits you can follow. But show me the real answers can using different directions to comment about that. They just my habits actually, from the equations that we can see that the theoretical power is reduced by 19% for this degree temperature and heat changethen so quite soonit's about the hate change to velocity change and power change

现在，它将很容易帮助我们煮大约10°的空气密度。和一些，如果你这么说，我可以转换它或者我可以把它复制到10°的L密度吗？零积分没有人也很好，因为以前我们也有不同程度的脸，划船通过将空气密度设为10次发射让我们计算一下眼镜的力量。但是0米在大海之上有一个0米左右的海然后我们想要在2000米高空的理论功率。我们也把这些值代入方程。P零变成现实。但是记住因为如果我们反过来看这个方程式我可以说，他们将是这里的另一种温度，茶为了积极的改变，这里也有一个团队。其实这茶，如果这两个我会改变它这个T应该是因为TTU这不是T零这是一种温度艺术。可能是所有的客观态度。所以对于这个问题这个T是T。10°, 还有，你可以看到我能换个顺序吗？我能换成只计算第十行吗10°，然后行10°2000年我是ASL，这可能也很好，因为她只是方程的转换。对于这些例子，我计算了p零，然后时代效率E或变化方程。但实际上，这是一回事。这是很多。如果你试着把这个方程展开，它等于200, A, 和路田纳西时代这个E什么是即零在保存时代固定装置零应该是添加您可以遵循的习惯。但是告诉我真正的答案。可以使用不同的方向来评论这一点。它们只是我的习惯。实际上，从方程中我们可以看到，理论功率减少了19%为了这个度温度和热量变化然后所以很快这是关于仇恨的改变。速度变化和功率变化

Assume that above speed value applies to a height of 10 meters above the ground. How does the power change in percentage of the winter by raising stored centimeter? Above the ground? The air density of heat change is he groaned If the heat air density of heat change is ignoredwhat's upWhat kind of parameters it impacts from the altitude changeFor any question before, only the velocity he zero, 10 meters hit after 20 meterstake into the directly into the equationsV zero is a velocity before, and we is a velocity afterAnd considering Alpha equals two and probability each one, we have cultivated that the velocity change is 1 point 125~1.149 to original times the original velocity Somethingthe powerbut the power is 3 times be the by install the wind turbines10 meters higherwe can have an increase of the output powered by 42~52 percent. Quite a big change.

假设上述速度值适用于地面以上10米的高度。通过提高存储的厘米，功率在冬季的百分比中如何变化？在地面上？热量变化的空气密度他在呻吟如果忽略热量空气密度的变化怎么了高度变化会影响哪些参数？对于之前的任何问题，只有速度他零，10米20米后击中直接带入方程V0是之前的速度，而We是之后的速度考虑到α等于2，概率为1，我们已经培养了这一点速度变化是1分125~1.149倍原始速度某物力量但是力量是3倍成为通过安装风力涡轮机高出10米我们可以通过以下方式增加输出42, ~52, 百分比相当大的变化

Right nowin China, as I knowthis is the reason why we have the one megawatts winter events today. And a offshore for offshore wind turbinesThese numbers changes to one point. Thank you. Capacitymegawatts What's the number beforeLike 10 years agowhen I was working in the industrythis is a 10 years ago Power and mechanical advance. And one advanced development promotes we have much bigger turbines, wind turbines Shut up. How are you? What's the matter? Interesting It's behind the lawsBecause when I normally they said not a joke, but I when I tried to introduce the sum of prpv systems, I always like to you use this figure where in high slides that you are going to shining once, it doesn't, it will not work It's because you are much younger than me. You might not watch this movie and will be a very funny movies when I was when I was actually.

马上据我所知，在中国这就是我们今天举办一兆瓦冬季活动的原因。和A离岸用于海上风力涡轮机这些数字变为一个点谢谢容量兆瓦前面的数字是多少？就像10年前当我在这个行业工作的时候这是10年前的动力和机械推进。一项先进的发展促进了我们拥有更大的涡轮机，风力涡轮机。闭嘴。你好吗怎么了有趣的它在法律的背后。因为当我通常他们说的不是笑话，而是我试图介绍的时候。PRPV系统的总和，我总是喜欢你用这个数字。在高滑梯上，你要发光一次，它不会，它不会工作。这是因为你比我小很多。你可能不会看这部电影，并将成为一个非常有趣的电影，当我当我实际上

Okay It is something very but we reset that this size a lot going to do is whySo for generations accelerate todayThe pv panels is not that advancedparticularly for commercial useSo in laboratory this efficiency. But now, as I know that Stanford, this should be Stanford or miti can't remember if you could reach about 30%, but it's only a laboratory For commercial use. We have 2 kinds, TV panels, TV classes, and pv panels has a conversion efficiency of 15 to 20%. And kiwi glasses have the efficiency of 9 to 10%. This efficiency means the energy that reached the pv panel No, sorry, the electricity generated by the pv panel divided by the solar energy that reached the surface of the unit panel It's still very low today This kind of things, it's really space dominated that basic calculations for solar energy

好的这是一件非常但是我们重新设置了这个尺寸，这就是为什么所以世世代代今天加速光伏电池板并没有那么先进。特别是用于商业用途。所以在实验室里这种效率。但现在，据我所知，斯坦福，这应该是斯坦福或MITI，我不记得你是否能达到30%，但它只是一个实验室。用于商业用途。我们有2种，电视面板，电视类，光伏电池板的转换效率为15%至20%。猕猴桃玻璃的效率为9%至10%。这种效率意味着到达光伏电池板的能量不，对不起，光伏电池板产生的电力除以到达电池板表面的太阳能今天仍然很低。这种事情，真的是空间主导的那太阳能的基本计算

Before talking about calculations, I see that how much solar energy that reaches usAnd how much we can use the solid relations about this launch reaches usand direct reflection goes back to spaceLong wave reflection goes back to spacethen about how much will be, nearly half of this is stored in ambit hitThat is why we have our we'll have20°or10°today, or if we do not have the amid heat safety in the air that maybe it's a freezing outside, we cannot live here. Now absorb the irradiation stall in the air, water, and the grounds as low temperature heatRemember,  low temperature heat is currently in the researchin research and in advanced technologiesWe try to use these wordsSo utilization of the local temperature hit is very important in future, particularly to reach carbon neutrality. Maybe even if you have interest you can read Google some informations about low temperature, Haiti utilization and how many anyway

在谈论计算之前，我看到有多少太阳能到达我们这里以及我们可以使用多少我们得到了关于这次发射的可靠关系直接反射回到太空。长波反射回到太空然后大约有多少，其中近一半存储在Ambit Hit中这就是为什么我们有我们今天将有20°或10°，或者如果我们在空气中没有高温安全，那可能外面很冷，我们不能住在这里。现在吸收空气、水和地面中的辐射，作为低温热量记住，低温加热目前是在研究中在研究和先进技术方面我们试着用这些词。所以利用率当地温度的冲击非常重要在未来，特别是要达到碳中性。也许即使你有兴趣，你也可以阅读谷歌一些关于低温，海地利用和信息反正有多少

Give me some kind of about when you select your masters pathway and then the rest of the solar radiation into the weather phenomena, water ice ran for and also goes into wind waves and photosynthesisPhotosynthesis And how to calculate these if 121,000the kind of ones that reach the earth is distributed uniformly. This is a very idea scenario. Over the earth's surface, the results for a horizontal surfaceThese the results for the horizontal surface that capture that mean annual power should be relations divided by the area of the surface We have 20737. What what's a square meters that reached on the surface of us If we can't see the only the daily hours, daytime hours, the results will be doubled. This is because the way in the personal calculation is in,  it means that it's for 24 hours We have 24 hours steady time, but we do not have that much. So for us 12 metersthe daytime will be shorter money, 12 hours, so that annual power will be double

当你选择你的明师之路时，给我一些关于然后，太阳辐射的其余部分变成了天气现象，水冰跑了，也变成了风浪和光合作用。光合作用和如何计算这些如果121,000, 那种能到达的地球是均匀分布的。这是一个非常好的想法。场景。在地球表面上，水平表面的结果这些水平表面的结果捕捉到了这一点年幂应关系除以曲面的面积。我们有207, 37.什么到达我们表面的一平方米是什么？如果我们不能只看到每天的时间，白天的时间，结果会加倍。这是因为个人计算的方式是在，这意味着它是24小时。我们有24小时的稳定时间，但我们没有那么多。所以对我们来说是12米白天就要短钱，12个小时，这样年发电量将增加一倍

If we multiply the energy in power bythis is how many hours per yearThe solar energy throughout the year would be this much.  Bye bye byeVery rare idea todayWhen we discuss something about the power generations from pv panels, particularly for rooftopfor bip, which building integrated pv systems, this number is about 1/3 of that on the spider number oneIt's just to have like per square being put square meters in certain, as I can remember, is it might not be that accurate, but around 800 about that much Questions where this value change because of different climate conditions on earthWhen we calculated that, we assume that is everything the average Everything is not averageSo when you talking about or basically calculated about the useful solar energies

如果我们把能量乘以这是每年多少小时全年的太阳能将是这么多拜拜拜拜今天非常罕见的想法。当我们讨论光伏电池板的发电，特别是屋顶发电时，对于建筑一体化光伏系统的BIP来说，这个数字大约是它的1/3。在一号蜘蛛上。它只是把每平方米放在一定的地方，我记得，它可能不是那么准确，但在800左右。大约这么多问题这个值因为地球上不同的气候条件而变化。当我们计算时，我们假设这是平均值。一切都不一般。所以当你谈论或基本上计算有用的太阳能

It means a climate about the different climate conditions because things were quite differentParticularly most of you might go to UK and you will I would like to send you good luck because you are not enjoy any daytime in winterparticularly if you go to Glasgow or Edinburgh or go Scotland or if you have opportunities, you can take your masters in Norway or Denmarkwhich means that I have a very funny example that my PhD mateI'll have a friend who worksJust reversely, which means that he sleeps during the daytime, he works at night That one day, which is the rainy day in around the Christmas hayseed odds eight aM in the morningAt that time they not in UK is definitely dark outsideFirst, at that time, maybe the sunrise is about 9:30 amHe stayed until 4 pm he did not enjoy any daytime because sunset is 3:00 pm He successfully skip all the sunshine as that day When we selectively calculate about the solar power, remember that this equation is a very basic and it's not very accurate to use.

它的意思是关于不同气候条件的气候，因为事物是完全不同的。特别是你们中的大多数人可能会去英国，你们会去的。我想送你好运，因为你不喜欢冬天的任何一天特别是如果你去格拉斯哥或爱丁堡，或者去苏格兰，或者如果你有机会，你可以在挪威或丹麦获得硕士学位。这意味着我有一个非常有趣的例子，我的博士同学我会有一个朋友谁工作正好相反，也就是说他白天睡觉，晚上工作。那一天，是雨天里的哪一天圣诞节前后乡巴佬赔率八上午10:00那个时候他们不在英国，外面肯定是黑的。第一，在那个时候，也许日出是在上午9:30左右。他一直呆到 4, 下午他不喜欢任何白天，因为日落。是下午3点他成功地跳过了那天所有的阳光。当我们有选择地计算太阳能时，请记住，这个方程是非常基本的，使用起来不是很准确。

You need to consider about the climate zones, climate scenarios for different places. So today,  when people try to do planning and they normally do so much of any or some other things, because no physical models could explain everything.  We try to use machine learning using data to predict the dataSo some students you have interest, you can read a lot of the attitude, extend the readings, and then you find out your interest in the futureRight? Let's see what's the time of the shall we say? How can youMaybe we stopped him here today. And if you have any questions, you can come to me. I will stay here until 10:00, 40:00 and next week. Remember I hope you can preview our lecture S

你需要考虑气候区，气候情景不同的地方。所以今天，当人们试图做计划和他们通常会做很多其他的事情，因为没有物理模型可以解释一切。我们尝试使用机器学习使用数据来预测数据。所以有些同学你有兴趣，你可以抱着大量阅读的态度，延伸阅读，然后你找出你未来的兴趣对的？让我们看看几点了。的我们可以说你怎么能也许我们今天在这里阻止了他。如果你有任何问题，你可以来找我。我会在这里待到10:00，40:00和下周。记得我希望你能预习一下我们的讲座。
