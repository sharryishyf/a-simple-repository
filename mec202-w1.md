Thanks. So this is basically what you need to do. What is module like Ask For the213, 4 of this wardrobe are the only thing here and the module leader. And previously this module development was delivered by professor Jason And from this year,  I'm the motivator, but she will still be in the teaching team to give you guidance on the both experiments and also the good projectThen you have a lot of our contact details and availability for office hours are listed in this table. And then so I will not read it and then you check it upwardsProfessor Phil and me will both be available in the afternoon tomorrow. So if you have any questions that you need to discuss with us,  you can just come to our off office, too.  We can have a detailed discussion or whatever They are mostly here for anything related to this wardrobe thing. We can have a discussion for experiments, talking projects or have a and we will be available on every Wednesday and then you could just feel free to contact us RightAs for myself,  some of me and some of you don't.  And I will briefly introduce what I do.  So for my basic information is available on the web page Right? Let's see if I can open it,  you can.  So that's my basic profile and my teaching research interests as well as my recent publications or isn't here.  So you can have a check about some detailed information on what I do. And essentially I I just have given a few key words or what I do for both teaching and research,  basically ideal development, integration of the a whole electronic systems, including a robot.  I can do this. So on both hardware aspects and the software aspects In order to be able to develop a typical electronic system such as an industrial robotic systems,  I need to know how to do emotion control to make the open arm each access, to do something called coordinated motion.

谢谢。所以这基本上是你需要做的。模块是什么样的？问对于213来说，4号衣柜是这里唯一的东西，而且是模块的领导者。以前这个模块的开发是由贾森教授完成的。从今年开始，我是激励者，但她仍将在教学团队中为你们提供实验和好项目的指导。那你有很多此表列出了我们的联系方式和办公时间。然后我就不读了，然后你再往上查。菲尔教授和我明天下午都有空。所以如果你有任何问题需要和我们讨论，你可以来我们的办公室。办公室也是。我们可以详细讨论一下。他们来这里主要是为了与衣柜有关的事情。我们可以讨论实验，讨论项目或进行我们每周三都有空，然后你可以随时联系我们。对的至于我自己，我中的一些人和你们中的一些人不知道。我简单介绍一下我是做什么的。所以我的基本信息可以在网页上找到。对的？让我们看看我能不能打开它，你可以。那么这是我的基本概况和我的教学研究兴趣，以及我最近的出版物或不在这里。所以你可以查看一些详细的信息做。和本质上我只是给出了几个关键词，或者说我所做的教学和研究，基本上是理想的。发展、一体化包括机器人在内的整个电子系统。我能做到的。那么硬件方面和软件方面为了能够开发一个典型的电子系统，如工业机器人系统，我需要知道如何去做。情绪控制为了让打开的手臂每次都能进入，做一些叫做协调运动的事情。

So that is in the scope of the motion control,  I do system integration. I do control of economics, the motion of each axis of the robot arm And in order to achieve economic motion of broke arm to make it more precisely,  definitely, you need to know how to deal with computer vision things. Then this is also one of my cities. I also do computer vision and finallyI also do digital screen with application in intelligent manufacturing and industrial automation. And as regards what is digital twinYeah, I believe some of it and I will not give in detail here because that's a long story.

所以这是在运动控制的范围内，我做系统集成。我做经济学的控制，运动的机器人手臂的每个轴为了实现断臂的经济运动，使其更加精确，你需要知道如何处理计算机视觉的东西。那么这也是我的一个城市。我也做计算机视觉，最后我也做智能制造和工业自动化应用的数字屏。至于什么是数字孪生是的，我相信其中的一些，我不会在这里给出细节，因为这是一个很长的故事。

And if you want to know what digital 20 years and you can just search on,  you can just clapping this key word in chap GPT and it will give you a very good answer.  So I just listed my expertise here. And if any of you feel interested in these topics,  you can either select my projects on the multiplication and in the future, you can, yeahwe can work together to do with your part of your projects, as well as we can also do some sub projects.  If you have interest on these topics,  we can just have a discussion in my office hours. And if you don't have time in my office hours and we can arrange another time to have a further talk on this, right Electronic systems with motion control, with vision and also development of a digital twin for this mapping trunk systems that so it's something like thisAnd for what my details you can just search on my web page to see my recent applications and get more detailed ideas on what I really do, rightAnd for as you have already noticed that let me switch off my love for learning more page.  What I have we have already provided you some topics for you to consider to select for a group project. This is not all I I have not yet upload my project and I will be updating this folder with my projects Good eveningBy before this Thursday. And then you will see what sort of project I will be providing. And then if you're interested,  we just had a talk. But even if I don't do a even I before I upload my projects,  you can also to take a detailed room on the key words I just provided. And my project provided to you will be no more than those. Okay These two slides just have listed a few accomplishments out of our module.  So as you will see for this module, you not only work on and complete a coreA project, based course work

如果你想知道什么是数字20年，你可以搜索，你可以在第章GPT中点击这个关键词，然后它会给你一个很好的答案。那么我只是在这里列出了我的专长。如果你们中的任何人对这些主题感兴趣，你们可以选择我关于乘法的项目，在未来，你可以，是的我们可以一起做你的项目的一部分，我们也可以做一些子项目。如果你对这些话题感兴趣，我们可以在我的办公时间进行讨论。如果你在我的办公时间没有时间，我们可以再安排一次是时候进一步讨论这个问题了，对吧？电子系统与运动控制，与视觉和数字孪生发展对于这个映射中继系统，它是这样的。关于我的详细信息，你可以在我的网页上搜索，查看我最近的申请，并获得关于我真正做什么的更详细的想法，对吗？和为了正如你已经注意到的，让我关掉我对学习更多页面的热爱。我所拥有的我们已经提供给你了。您可以考虑为组项目选择一些主题。这还不是全部，我还没有上传我的项目，我将用我的项目更新这个文件夹。晚上好在这个星期四之前。然后你会看到我会是什么样的项目。提供。如果你感兴趣的话，我们刚刚谈过了。但即使我在上传我的项目之前没有做任何事情，你也可以。对我刚才提供的关键词进行了详细的房间。和我提供给你的项目不会比那些更多。好的这两张幻灯片刚刚列出了我们模块中的一些成就。正如您将在本模块中看到的，您不仅是处理并完成核心基于课程作业的项目

But more importantly, you are able to gain some practical skills and also with the practical skills,  you will be able to participate in some national wide competitions. And hopefully you can get a price out of that In the following few weeks,  I would say before week five,  I I will give you provide you with much information on the oncoming competitions. It can be worldwide competitions can be national world. Competitions can be provincial company. Competition can be city wide competitions and then I'll give you a lot of people a lot of information on this kind of competitions and yeah, when you feel interested and more importantly, if you feel you have the capability to complete the work and get the price, and then we can have a deal.

但更重要的是，你能够获得一些实用技能，而且有了这些实用技能，你将能够参加一些全国性的比赛。希望你能从中得到一个价格在接下来的几周里，我会说在第五周之前，我会给你提供很多关于即将到来的比赛的信息。它可以是世界性的比赛，也可以是全国性的世界比赛。比赛可以是省公司的。比赛可以是全市范围的比赛，然后我会给你很多人。很多关于这方面的信息比赛和是的，当你感兴趣的时候，更重要的是，如果你觉得你有能力完成工作并得到价格，那么我们就可以达成交易。

We can have a more little discussion about your intention as well as how you're going to devote your time on that Once you start to work with that, and we all wish to get some accomplishments like prices such as those listed down here. So these two slides just trying to let you know you get not only practical skills, not only basic knowledge from the virtual, but more importantly, you have opportunity to win price out of a competition.  And that is not only for this in futurewe can collaborate, we can work together with some self research projectsGet publications. Why not get patents? Why not? Right SARS for our module herethere are a few things which renders this module very different from the cost modules you have previously taken sense of all. This is a project based moduleThis module do not follow any specific textbookOr rather, you need to work out what information you need to get and what you need to do to complete a project to develop something that can work nicely. And that is also useful in order to do this kind of taskthere must be something, some gap between the basic knowledge in previous land and something that you need to do.  So the main thing here is theI'm trying to mention what is the gap between knowledge learning and industrial requirements? Knowledge learning means. So you have previously thoughtAnd then requirements means what you want to dowhat you want to develop. Thank you The right I II do not really want to read all these key words here, but those these ideas are very apparent. I will give you an exampleI will give you an example And then you tell me how many solutions could be,  and then what you want to do say, for exampleyou are going to develop some support there would,  let's talk about the easiest thingIf you're going to drive adc motorwhat are going to do If you're going to drive adc motor say, for example,  if I want to achieve different speeds of adc motor, what are going to doIs there only one solution? Nowthere must be many say, for example, you want to do a speed control, you want to go to the speed of the DC motor We know that I think they want toIf you just connect the battery with adc motor, it can only give you a single speed, right? And then higher going to off ten different speeds Most traditional way, you use the gearbox, you use the gearbox

我们可以有更多关于你的意图以及你将如何投入时间的讨论。一旦你开始工作，我们都希望取得一些成就，比如价格就像这里列出的那些。那么这两张幻灯片只是想让你知道，你从虚拟世界中获得的不仅是实用技能，不仅是基本知识，更重要的是，你有机会赢得价格。在比赛中出局。这不仅仅是为了这个。在未来我们可以合作，我们可以一起做一些自我研究的项目。获取出版物。为什么不申请专利？为什么不？对的非典对于我们这里的模块有几件事。这使得此模块与您以前采用的成本模块所有的感觉。这是一个基于项目的模块本模块不遵循任何特定的教科书或者更确切地说，你需要弄清楚你需要得到什么信息，你需要做什么来完成一个项目，开发一些可以很好地工作的东西。这也是有用的。为了完成这种任务一定有的一些东西，一些差距介于前人的基本知识和你需要做的事。所以这里最重要的是我想说的是知识学习和工业要求之间的差距是什么？知识学习手段。所以你以前认为然后需求意味着你想做什么？你想发展什么？谢谢右边我真的不想在这里读所有这些关键词，但这些想法是非常明显的。我给你举个例子。我给你举个例子。然后你来告诉我有多少种解决方案，然后你想做什么比方说你将在那里发展一些支持，让我们谈谈最简单的事情。如果你要驱动ADC电机你要做什么？如果你要驱动ADC电机例如，如果我想实现ADC电机的不同速度，我们要做什么？只有一个解决办法吗？现在一定有很多。比如说，你想做一个速度控制，你想去直流电机的速度。我们知道我认为他们想。如果你只是把电池和ADC马达连接在一起，它只能给你一个单一的速度，对吗？然后更高，提供十种不同的速度。最传统的方式，你使用变速箱，你使用变速箱

In a mechanical way, you order the space. And there is another way that is to alter the voltage level instead of using a fixed voltage, say, for example, we are trying to drive a we are trying to drive adc voter,  which has a rated voltage of 24 volts.  If you've got 24 volts DC voltage, then you got the full speedHowever,  if we want to get a slower speed, then you definitely need to lower down the voltage level. How are you going to doIf you don't use the other,  if I say you can't use gearbox, then you need to use another means to alter 3 year for this level.  You're going to lower the water level. How long to doYeah, there's some technical called pwm, right? So this is very familiar to you, rightPwm, you alter the duty cycle, you alter the duty cycle of the pw and waveform that you get different mean value for every voltage. And in this way, you change the speed of the motor oki gave you two waysThere must be some other ways, right? Think about this. All right. So I'm telling this story for whatSo firstlyyou need to have a cognitive flexibility that is to say, you need to have the capability to think about two or more concepts.  One for that DC motor case, I have already give you two concepts Maybe I only know these two concepts if more.  I'm very happy that he can tell me. OkaySomething, rightAnd secondly, negotiationYeah,  what kind of effort, what aspects can you think of that you might need a negotiation Functionality and cost SomethingWe need a negotiation.  Your customer will give you very demanding requirements, but they would ask you to control the price in accordance with some very low things such as a appeal to do that.

以机械的方式，你对空间进行排序。和还有另一种方法，即改变电压电平例如，我们不使用固定电压，而是尝试驱动我们正在尝试驱动额定电压为24伏的ADC表决器。如果你有24伏的直流电压，那么你就可以全速行驶。然而，如果我们想要获得更慢的速度，那么你肯定需要降低电压水平。你打算怎么做？如果你不使用另一个，如果我说你不能使用变速箱然后你需要用另一种方法来改变。此级别为3年。你要降低水位。做多长时间是的，有一种叫做PWM的技术，对吧？这对你来说很熟悉，对吗？PWM，你改变占空比，你改变PW和波形的占空比，你得到每个电压的不同平均值。通过这种方式，你改变了速度马达的大木给了你两种方法一定还有其他方法，对吧？想想这个。好吧。所以我讲这个故事是为了什么？所以首先你需要有认知灵活性，也就是说，你需要有思考两个或更多概念的能力。一个是直流电机的，我已经有了。给你两个概念。也许我只知道这两个概念。我很高兴他能告诉我。好的一些东西，对第二，谈判是啊，什么样的努力，哪些方面你能想到你可能需要谈判。功能和成本某物我们需要谈判。你的客户会给你非常苛刻的要求，但是他们会要求你这么做。控制价格根据一些非常低的东西，如呼吁这样做

ByebyeNice.  My requirements are very demanding. I would like you, too. YeahDebate to build me a robot which can move with a very high possession, but with very low price but with pink dollar price,  then how are you going to doYeah, you must do this or you will lose this contract. ByebyeOkay. So then you have a few ways.  Then I say, I can't do it. I quit. All rightBut mostly you won't do this, right You need to think about some way that you can achieve this Definitely, I would saysuspect and solution use pwa will use P using pwm waveform to continue to alter the speed of the DC motor will be more economical than using near boss, rightThis is one thing.  So we use the same story to think about these things. You need to make a compromise. You need to make a negotiation in between price and functionality or if reallyYeah,  they ask you to control the body to a very low level, then then after careful assessmentyou think that you cannot really, you cannot really achieve that functionality that you need to negotiate with your customer to say that II why really can't do that.

拜拜好看的。我的要求很苛刻。我也喜欢你。是啊辩论给我造一个机器人，它可以用很高的占有量移动，但价格很低，但价格是粉红色的美元，那么你打算怎么做？是的，你必须这样做，否则你会失去这份合同拜拜好的。所以你有几种方法。然后我说，我做不到。我不干了好吧但大多数情况下你不会这么做，对吧？你需要考虑一些方法来实现这一点。当然，我会说。怀疑和解决方案使用PWA将使用P使用PWM波形继续改变直流电机的速度将比使用近老板更经济，对不对？这是一件事。所以我们用同样的故事来思考这些事情。你需要做出妥协。你需要在价格和功能之间进行协商。或如果真的是的，他们要求你把身体控制到一个非常低的水平，然后然后经过仔细评估。你认为你不能。真的，你不能真的实现您需要与客户协商功能，告诉他们为什么不能这样做。

And also you indicate to them that no other companies, no other parties will be able to do this and then say they were believing you and then okay say I can lower down the requirement negotiation.  So this is not for developing some engineering projects. There is no black and white things that they always have some gray areas that is something like that is negotiablePrepare a job as well as the results

你也向他们表明，没有其他公司，没有其他政党能够这样做，然后说他们相信你，然后好吧，说我可以降低要求谈判。所以这不是为了开发一些工程项目。没有非黑即白的事情。他们总是有一些灰色地带。差不多吧可以商量准备工作和结果

Service orientation is well service orientation that means yet more likely the requirements. So you need to make sure that something you developed really caters for the public needs.  You never really want to develop something that is useless such as looks good, but it is not practical at all something that can be need to B be useful need to be practical need to cater for Tastes of the majority, then you can earn moneyIf notyou lose money quickly not, right Funny judgment and decision making. This is my parents. YeahAnd a lot of our business fails because of the wrong decision making of the leadership team

面向服务就是面向服务，这意味着更有可能的要求。所以你需要确保你开发的东西真的迎合了公众需要。你永远不会真的想开发一些无用的东西，比如看起来不错，但根本不实用的东西。有用需要实用需要迎合大多数人的口味，然后你可以赚到钱如果没有你输钱很快，不是吗？有趣的判断和决策。这是我父母。是啊由于领导团队的错误决策，我们的很多业务都失败了。

There are a lot of stories, there are a lot of stories Take a look at this mobile applications that previously like decades agoiPhone are not popular at all decades ago. The mobile phones that are popular and NOKIA MOTOROLA females something they prepare the market of mobile phones. But why now iPhone becomes one of the most popular iPhones because the owner of the leadership team of the apple company made the right decision. They primary jobs. If a primary state jobs, this guy is very smart and he very prestigevery accurately predicted the future trend for the development of this market and develop something that is very good and can take us for can fulfill the taste of the most of the public while the other companies fails to make this right prediction.

有很多故事，有很多故事看看这个移动应用程序，就像几十年前一样。几十年前iPhone根本不流行。流行的手机和诺基亚摩托罗拉女性为手机市场准备了一些东西。但为什么现在iPhone成为最受欢迎的iPhone之一，是因为老板的领导团队。苹果公司做出了正确的决定。他们主要工作。如果一个主要的州工作，这个人很聪明，他很有威望非常准确地预测了这个市场未来的发展趋势，很好，可以带我们去。可以满足大多数公众的口味。而其他公司却没有做出正确的预测。

And then they were out of the market.  So something like this Then probably these few keywords are now still very abstract. Two of you once you start to yet do with something real kind ofIn particular, when you finish your school study and enter into society, and you will be able to have a deep understanding of what it really means, basicallyYeah, you need to be creative,  something you need to be creative Need to be sad to a background always trying to make right decision. Although this is not possible,  everybody will make your opposition. So this is not possible, but we try our best to make right decisions Then how are going to do thisYeah, how we're going to do this. We need to look a lot,  we need to look more, we need to feel the everyday life to have enough accumulationthen you'll be able to make right decision

然后他们退出了市场。所以像这样的东西然后大概这几个关键词现在还很抽象。你们两个一旦开始做一些真正的事情特别是当你完成学业进入社会的时候，你就能深刻理解它的真正含义，基本上。是的，你需要有创意，一些你需要有创意的东西需要悲伤背景总是试图做出正确的决定。虽然这是不可能的，但每个人都会提出反对意见。所以这是不可能的，但我们尽力了。做出正确的决定。那我们要怎么做呢？是啊，我们要怎么做。我们需要看很多，我们需要看更多，我们需要感受日常生活要有足够的积累然后你就能做出正确的决定。

And in the meantime,  I would say, so this world is not black and white. Yeah. And then everything need to have a compromise, need to have a negotiation, and that's it Then we know this. But when we are in practice,  it's not that easy.  That's rightOkay. So this like just this is something similar A you need to have a emotional Intelligence that is something like EQ.  What does it mean? You need to work these people, you need an emotional Intelligencecoronation, people management. These reports are similar that you need to work through people,  the former group, right? So that is something that you are in a different faceright?  What you were former group to work with some projects.

和同时，我想说，这个世界不是非黑即白的。是啊然后每件事需要妥协，需要谈判，就是这样。然后我们知道这个。但当我们练习时，就不那么容易了。对的好的。所以这就像这是类似的东西。你需要有一个情商，就像情商一样。它是什么意思？你需要和这些人合作，你需要情商。加冕，人员管理。这些报告是相似的，你需要通过人，前一组工作，对吗？所以这是你在不同的面孔上的东西。是吧？你以前的团队是做一些项目的。

YeahOn the third half of this module,  you will have a two people group to work on experiments.  The next you will have four or five people work on a good project. Then you need to talk to them and you need to communicate. You need to have an effective communication to to be able to enable a best performance of your team and also yourself There will be a lot of cases that it is unavoidable that you work with somebody you don't like It doesn't mean that you will never really work with him or her. Now you have to work with them even even you have some colleagues, you don't like you have to work with them, you have to collaborate for the project, but for the other private things certain a area.

是啊在本模块的后半部分，您将有一个两人小组来进行实验。接下来你会有四到五个人在做一个好的项目。那你需要和他们交谈，你需要沟通。你需要有一个有效的通信至能够让你的团队和你自己有最好的表现会有很多这样的情况和你不喜欢的人一起工作是不可避免的。这并不意味着你永远不会真正与他或她一起工作。现在你甚至要和他们一起工作。即使你有一些同事，你不喜欢你必须和他们一起工作，你必须为项目合作，但为其他私人的事情一定要合作。区域。

All right?  So we don't care about this, but for this projectsince your colleague we work together, then you need to grab yourself Regardless of some private issues you have that is these thingscreativity and critical thinking Creativity, critical thinking. I would say this to our relationship You need to be have the ability of creativity.  You are creative, and then you will be having a critical thing in critical thinking is that what is critical thinking means when you read a textbook Textbook cannot be always around. Textbook can be wrong because some of textbook are really writing bullshit. I tell you, okaySo then you need to know it's really is some textbooks, especially some textbooks. Do you know where the wet is from? Right? They are just writing bullshit. Something on the textbooks is wrong, then you need to you need to spotthey are talking bullshit and then doing the right things.

好吧？所以我们不关心这个，而是为了这个项目。既然你的同事我们一起工作，那么你需要抓住自己不管你有什么私人问题。这些东西创造力和批判性思维创造力，批判性思维。我想说的是我们的关系。你需要是具有创造能力。你是有创造力的，然后你会在批判性思维中有一个关键的东西，那就是当你阅读教科书时，批判性思维意味着什么。教科书不可能永远在身边。教科书可能是错误的，因为有些教科书真的在写废话。我告诉你，好吗？所以你需要知道它真的是一些教科书，特别是一些教科书。你知道雨是哪里来的吗？对的？他们只是在写废话。如果课本上的内容有错误，那么你需要你需要发现他们在胡说八道，然后做正确的事情。

Not just apply that we follow them,  textbooks can be wrong. And also I I can tell you bullshit because II do not know everything, okayFor something. Maybe what I tell is wrong, then you need to.point out you can,  if I tell you something wrongmaybe today, maybe in future, just that you talk to me and then tell me why,  I'm telling you bullshit, it's okay Don't always believe in me, okayRight. So that is critical thinking, right For complex problem solving Yeah, these are some very old old fashioned saying you need to be able to solve complex problem and then what is complex problem What's the complex problem Motor control Stop such a small story just told you that is not a complex body. OkayFor complex problems let's saySingapore company,  I give you this picture, so it is on the flights almost there

不仅仅是应用，我们遵循它们，教科书可能是错误的。我也可以告诉你胡说八道，因为我不知道一切，好吗？为了某事。也许我说的是错的，那么你需要.指出你可以，如果我告诉你什么是错的。也许今天，也许将来，只要你告诉我，然后告诉我为什么，我告诉你胡说八道，没关系。不要总是相信我，好吗？对的。这就是批判性思维，对吧？用于解决复杂问题是的，这些都是非常古老的老式的说法是，你需要能够解决复杂的问题，然后什么是复杂的问题？复杂的问题是什么？电机控制停止这样一个小故事，只是告诉你，不是一个复杂的机构。好的对于复杂的问题让我们说新加坡公司，我给你这张照片，所以它在航班上几乎有。

What am I going to askAll right, it is under the lights.  Okay I wanted to sort of this one build it from scratchThis is a complex problem.  How we will take away will come over here after a few minutes.  Then it is your your responsibility to tell me later, how are we to do this complex problem solving. OkayWhat do you need to concern for building this CNC machine?  That's CNC machine Complex problem What are you going to do? What aspects are you going to do?  Where's my previous slide of compass problem solving to come for complex problem solving? OkayWhat are you going to do? First, I I will tell you, first of all, you to think about in this way, what energy, what energies will be get involved in this whole system, and then how I go to convert itThat's all about these thingsEverything in our world is about energy conservationYou believe this thing you have to believe in me, okay Our for our when we come to the world and until sometime after decades, we we will have the white and then finally, our body was like decomposed and then converting to addThat is also energy conservation.  We'll never tell what tell us this kind of story. It's not good one, put it upOkay, then but we just talk about say, for example, I ask you to go to that. Satur kind of a machine that kind of a partisan robotic system or that kind of computer numerical control machine.  You first think about what manager might be getting involved in it, and then how are you going to deal with it

我要问什么？好的，在灯光下。好的我想从零开始建造它。这是一个复杂的问题。我们将如何带走将在几分钟后来到这里。那就是你的你的责任是稍后告诉我，我们如何解决这个复杂的问题。好的建造这台数控机床你需要注意什么？那是数控机床复杂问题你打算怎么办？你打算从哪些方面着手？对于复杂问题的解决，我之前的指南针问题解决幻灯片在哪里？好的你打算怎么办？首先，我会告诉你，首先，你要以这种方式思考，什么能量，什么能量会被卷入其中。整个系统，然后我怎么去转换它。这就是关于这些事情的全部。我们世界的一切是关于节能的。如果你相信这件事，你必须相信我，好吗？我们当我们来到这个世界，直到几十年后的某个时候，我们我们会有白色的，最后，我们的身体就像分解然后正在转换为添加这也是节能。我们永远不会告诉什么告诉我们这种故事。这不是好的，把它挂起来。好的，但是我们只是说，例如，我要求你去那里。萨图尔一种机器，一种党派机器人系统，或者那种计算机数控机床。你先想想。什么经理可能会参与其中，然后你将如何处理它？

This is your starting point. Then next you are going you will be able to identify what subjects do you want to get involvedAnd then how to decompose themYeah, we talk about this later.  That's a complex problem. But when you're facing complex problems, don't panicTry to think about from Top to down, okay What energy needed? That's your first question,  alwaysNow we talk about the organization of our module,  so we have a teaching schedule.  This is week one, and I'm here to give you an introduction session to introduce to do what is modulus and what you need to do and what problems you might be facing for this module.

这是你的起点。然后下一步你要去，你将能够识别你想参与什么主题？然后如何分解它们？是的，我们以后再谈这个。那是个复杂的问题。但是当你面对复杂的问题时，不要惊慌。试着从上到下思考，好吗？需要什么能量？这是你的第一个问题，总是现在我们讲我们模块的组织，所以我们有一个教学进度。这是第一周，我在这里给大家介绍一下做什么是模数，你需要做什么，什么您在学习本模块时可能遇到的问题

PreviouslyI said you need to face the gap in between the traditional knowledge learning and the real customer needs. So that's the first thing you need to deal withThere are a lot of aspects and you need to be creative, you need to be quite critical, you need to be adaptive to work with people you like and you don't likeAnd also you need to be able to deal with confirmation and talk to people and then there to the get most of the benefits where we want to negotiate with people who want to get or get benefits. Right? That's it Finally,  technically solve complex problem,  complex problem, not only deal with, not for only technically, but also deal with people.  This is also complex problem.

以前我说你需要面对传统的知识学习和真正的客户需求之间的差距。所以这是你需要做的第一件事处理有很多方面。你需要有创造力，你需要相当挑剔，你需要适应与你喜欢和不喜欢的人一起工作。你也需要能够处理确认和与人交谈，然后去那里。大部分的好处我们希望与那些想要获得或得到好处的人进行谈判。对的？就是这样最后，从技术上解决复杂的问题，复杂的问题，不仅要处理，也不仅要从技术上解决。与人打交道。这也是一个复杂的问题。

You design the machine is a complex product. A machine is a complex for a cross stretch, complex problem. And during the process of developing a new machine, you need to work with people. This is a more difficult problem you need to solveYeah, probably there are someone really?  They are annoying and then you need to but you can't be annoyed. RightComplex problem two sides here with people technically and also scientifically. Yeah. RightSo in that confession today and then secondly,  in next week, I will give you instruction on how to do with a group project. And as you have already noticedtoday, I have already up loaded the part of the scope of the projects. Then you can consider the projects which I have already approached. And tonight, tomorrow before Thursday, I will upload another few project configurations and then you can read through the other product selections and then tell me what you want to do

你设计的机器是一个复杂的产品。机器是一个复杂的交叉伸展，复杂的问题。和在开发新机器的过程中，你需要与人合作。这是你需要解决的更困难的问题。是啊，可能有人的确他们很烦人，你需要这样做，但你不能生气。对的复杂的问题有两个方面，技术上和科学上都有。是啊对的所以在今天的忏悔中，第二，在下周，我会指导你们如何做一个小组项目。正如你已经注意到的今天，我已经上传了部分项目的范围。然后你可以考虑我已经接触过的项目。和今晚，明天周四之前，我会再上传一些。项目配置，然后你可以通读其他产品选择，然后告诉我你想做什么。

I would too in the next week, the same day in the next week, I will be here to tell you in detail what you are going to do on project as well as give you necessary to resources that you can refer to to start your project because nobody can think of an idea from scratch. You need to take reference about a lot of materials, and I will try to give you as much material as possible. Okay Today I already will give you some and then you can take a look and then get the ideaIncase incaseYou really cannot formulate idea and I I can give you a lot of open source projects, open source ideas and just pick up one from it that you feel comfortable. Okay We with one induction, with two instruction on how to do the group project. And in week three, I I will deliver to you some basic knowledge about sensors and typical example with sensors and week four and five will be experiments. You work on some sport experiments to get some idea of how to work with some basic and popularly use the census With five.  I will tell you some other stories. Yeah, like the I don't know what we call it quite well. Experiments on in week six, which will be our last lecture I will give you some comprehensive case studies For example,  I will show you how acnc machine, I just presented our slides, how it works and how it is developedLazy. So second machine is built by myself.  So I I can tell you how this works. And also I will provide you some ideas of the possible product selection, which will be working on this kind of machine. And then you try to work it outRightOrganization will be in this way.  I leave you to read through the slides and to get the idea of how at the time arrangement for this module. And next teaching contents, ok. So we have a that practice. So for lab sessions,  you will be doing the lab tasks with two people formulated group. So two people for like a group and this group will be arranged by us, it will be around the past. So probably you need to work with somebody. You don't know, and we will release the detailed group and allocation as soon as possible. And hopefully before next week,  we will be able to release the detail, the group allocation for the experiments

我也会的下个星期，下个星期的同一天，我会在这里告诉你详细说明你要在项目上做什么，以及给你您可以参考的必要资源开始你的项目是因为没有人能从零开始想出一个主意。你需要参考的资料很多，我会尽量给你更多的资料。好的今天我已经给了你一些，然后你可以看一看，然后得到的想法。InCase InCase, 你真的不能形成想法，我可以给你。很多开源项目，开源想法，从中挑选一个。你觉得舒服。好的我们用一个感应，用两个关于如何做小组项目的指导。在第三周，我将向你们介绍一些关于传感器的基本知识，以及传感器和第四周的典型例子。五个将是实验。你在一些运动上工作实验了解如何使用一些基本的和普遍使用的人口普查有五个。我会告诉你一些其他的故事。是啊就像我不太清楚我们怎么称呼它。实验将在第六周进行，这将是我们的最后一堂课我会给你一些广泛的案例研究例如，我将向您展示如何ACNC机器，我刚才展示了我们的幻灯片，它是如何工作的，以及它是如何开发的懒惰的。所以第二台机器是我自己造的。所以我可以告诉你这是怎么回事。我也会为您提供一些可能的产品选择的想法，这将是在这种机器上工作。然后你试着解决它。对的组织将以这种方式进行。我留给你通读幻灯片，了解如何在此模块的时间安排还有下一个教学内容不错。那么我们有一个练习。那么对于实验会话，您将执行实验任务与两人制定了小组。所以两个人就像一个团体和这个团体。将会是安排的由我们，它将围绕过去。所以你可能需要和某人合作。你不知道，我们会公布详细的分组和分配。越快越好希望在下周之前，我们能够公布实验的小组分配细节。

This is the thing areAnd next we do a group project, like I said, for group projectyou will be for group projects, you can find your group members by yourself and remember4 peoples, 4 to 5 people,  a group, five people most, 5 group of most,  do not formulate a group about more than five people, most 4 to 5 people group. So you can find your minds by yourself and do tell us your choice by today,  by the same date of next week, and so on After you have determined your group membersas well as the idea of your projects, you write us an Emailtelling us the members of your group, as well as the idea of your projects and send it to this Email address

这就是问题所在。是还有下一个我们做一个小组项目，就像我说的，小组项目。你会的对于组项目，您可以自己找到你的小组成员并记住。4人，4至5人，一组，5人最多，5组最多，不制定一组约5人以上，最多4至5人人群组。所以你可以自己找到你的想法，并告诉我们。你的选择今天之前，下周同一天之前如此等等在您确定了组成员之后以及你的项目的想法，你给我们写一封电子邮件告诉我们您的小组成员，以及您的项目的想法，并将其发送到此电子邮件地址

By next Tuesday, please. Right For lab sessions.  And later on,  if we have time, I can show you some content of the lab session For lab sessions,  there one thing that I need to let you know that I do not previously Let me open the bridge. So you have made a choice of which day you want to take the lab session, right So then the consequence wasyeah, the thing is that our next session will be will be held in two computer roomsThen for who is the initial allocation supposed to rules are fully occupied. And then we had to make some adjustment and we have moved some students to the session on Friday. So what I need to, which I would like to suggest is that you go back and have another check of the date when you are going to take the black session. And if you feel that state is not suitable to you, then do let us know

请在下周二之前。对的用于实验室会话。稍后，如果我们有时间，我可以向您展示一些实验内容对于实验课，有一件事我需要让你知道我以前没有让我打开桥。那么你已经选择了哪一天参加实验课，对吗？所以结果是是啊，问题是我们的下一次会议将是将在两个电脑室举行然后对于谁来说，最初的分配应该是规则被完全占用。然后我们不得不做一些调整，我们已经转移了一些学生。参加周五的会议。所以我需要，我想建议的是你回去再检查一次你要参加黑色会议的日期。如果你觉得这种状态不适合你，请告诉我们。

Then again, you send the Email to this Email address and saying that data not suits me. I want to change youTake enough,  you recheck your the date when you are taking the lab session in which room. And if you feel that they are not you to do, let us know as quick as possible by sending Email to the address.  YeahRight,  for good projects like our is that we have already up loaded some projects going to learning more than you can have a look and determine which one you need to go and then write down your idea in an Email with the names of your group members and send it to us to this Email address

然后，你再次发送电子邮件到这个电子邮件地址，并说数据不适合我。我想改变你。带够了，当你参加实验课程时，你要重新检查你的日期。在哪个房间。如果你觉得他们不是你要做的，让我们知道尽快发送电子邮件到该地址。是啊是的，对于像我们这样的好项目，我们已经加载了一些项目，以学习更多的东西，你可以看一看。确定你需要去哪一个，然后写下来。你的主意在电子邮件中提供您的小组成员的姓名，并将其发送给我们这个电子邮件地址

And in the meantime for this semester we have made a little change on the organization of the group projects. We have the general projects So mostly,  if you're working with some general projects, mostly there will be a junior basic projects, so which is a rapidly simple, which is ra relatively simple,  honestly

在此期间为了这个学期我们做了一点改变。在集团项目的组织。我们有一般的项目所以大多数情况下，如果你在做一些一般的项目，大多数情况下会有一个初级的基础项目，所以这是一个快速简单的项目，这是RA。老实说，相对简单

In the meantime, we also have offered some industrial projectsThese projects from our collaborative companies. So with these projects, you will have a chance to access the real industrial facilities and to access the real examples for the application, the real productsAnd in the effect is that this kind of projects definitely more challenging and more difficultThen if you're up to do this kind of project, you need to think carefully whether you are able to do itAnd then the one thing that I need to mention here,  regardless of the difficulty level of general purchase and industrial projects, so marketing standard will be exactly the same We will not say that you're right.  You're working on a multiple projects and II will send you automatically be granted a high Mark. This is a lot of things that we have the same marketing standardsYes, you have to be aware of this The thing is the reason for this is that okay Yeah,  frankly, there has no absolute fairness in all over this world, right?

同时，我们也提供了一些工业项目。这些项目来自我们的合作公司。所以有了这些项目，你就有机会了。访问真实的工业设施，访问真实的应用实例，访问真实的产品和效果是这类项目肯定更具挑战性，难度更大。然后，如果你想做这样的项目，你需要仔细考虑你是否有能力去做。然后我需要在这里提到的一件事是，无论一般采购和工业项目的难度如何，营销标准都是完全相同的。我们不会说你是对的。你在多个项目上工作，我会自动给你一个高分。这是很多事情我们都有相同的营销标准。是的，你必须意识到这一点事情是这样的，原因是好的坦白说，世界上没有绝对的公平，对吧？

If like I said, if afterwards you go to a company,  so your boss will never consider that you work on difficult projects and then if you did not perform nicely and then they were still speak kind of you This will never happen.  So if even if you work on a difficult project in a company, if your performance a lot is not that good,  your boss will still be not happy. Right? That's reality. So that is something you need to be awareAnd we need to aware of this. So bugsThey are one thing by working with the industrial projects what you can gain aerial skillsa real experiences

如果像我说的那样，如果你后来去了一家公司，那么你的老板会永远不要认为你在做困难的项目。如果你表现得不好他们还在说你的好话这永远不会发生。所以如果即使你在做一个困难的项目。在一个公司里，如果你的表现不是很好，你的老板还是会不高兴。对的？这就是现实。所以这是你需要注意的。我们需要意识到这一点。那么臭虫它们是一回事。通过与工业项目合作你能得到什么空中技巧一个真实的经历

Yeah, so you may choose some easy projects and get high marks The thing is in the endit is still that you ended up learning virtually nothingIf you choose to work on the real projectsmaybe your Mark is not that highExperience the knowledge you get will be very valuable in this wayit might be better for you, right? It might be better for you then after your graduationyou canYeah, with this kind of practical experience after graduationit might be easier for you to get an offer from Top level universities all over the world because they value real experiences betterThose Top level universities say look more on what experience your capability rather than your bossYeah, muscle,  because people know that Marx is not the most important thing because you can still know nothing even if you get 100% or more dream.

是的，所以你可以选择一些简单的项目并获得高分。事情到了最后。你最终还是学会了。实际上什么都没有如果你选择做真正的项目也许你的分数没那么高。体验你所获得的知识会很有价值。以这种方式对你来说可能更好，对吧？毕业后对你来说可能更好。你可以是啊，毕业后有了这样的实践经验你可能更容易得到世界各地的顶尖大学，因为他们更好地重视真实体验那些顶尖大学说，更多的是看你的能力，而不是你的老板。是的，肌肉，因为人们知道马克思不是最重要的东西，因为即使你得到了100%或更多的梦想，你仍然什么都不知道。

But they would value they would evaluate what you can do, what can you solve a problem That's totally different from marks. Right? So that is something that I need to get mentioned here. So if regardless of the difficult level of industrial projects to project and general projectsmarket standard is the same. However, if you work on this kind of challenging projects,  you trust, you have the capability,  and indeed you have the capability. And in the end, you can get a lotyou can gain a lot rather than just a monthwhich is meaningless.  This is my opinion.  Maybe you can disagree with me, but I do feel in this waymarket itself is meaninglessBut it is the knowledge, it is the skill, it is the experience which you gained. That can make you stand out in the future Right For the market allocation of our module.  PreviouslyI said, so you will do two small, flat sessions and the two smaller session will account for 25% of the module market. Then you completely experiments and you get the marksThen for the group projects it accounts for virtually75% of the module Mark.  And firstlyyou need to formulate your idea and detail lies it as quick as possible and write up a proposal which account for 10 months We would expect that you hand in your project proposal 5 week 757so that ideally, you formulate the groups in the next week and start working, start generating ideas and fix your ideas and in which seven summit a proposal with some details. The idea There's oneOur reason of doing this is that we can we can make sure if your progress is on trackThis is one thing.

但是他们会评估你能做什么，什么你能解决问题吗？那和马克完全不同。对的？那么这是我需要得到的东西。这里提到的。所以如果不分难度等级的工业项目和一般项目。市场标准是一样的。然而，如果你从事这种具有挑战性的项目，你信任，你有能力，你确实有能力。最后，你可以得到很多。你可以收获很多。而不是仅仅一个月这毫无意义。这是我的看法。也许你可以不同意我的观点，但我确实有这种感觉。市场本身毫无意义。但它是知识，是技能，是你获得的经验。那个可以让你在未来脱颖而出。对的对于我们模块的市场分配。以前我说，所以你将做两个小的，平坦的会话，这两个较小的会话将占模块市场的25%。然后你完全实验，你得到了分数。然后是小组项目它实际上占模块标记的75%。和首先你需要阐述你的想法并尽可能快地写出细节，并写出一份为期10个月的提案。我们预计你在5周内提交了你的项目提案757因此，理想情况下，你在下周制定小组并开始工作，开始产生想法并修正你的想法，并在其中七个峰会上提出建议。有一些细节这个想法有一个我们这样做的原因是我们可以我们可以确保你的进步是否在轨道上。这是一件事。

And secondly, if there's anything setting on realistic or that's difficult to handle in your project, we can discover as early as possible and then we can adjust our directionYou nobody wants that in the end,  I can't complete it and then ended up getting not that good performance in a module.  And then by handing into the proposal before we stand with help all of us to make sure that we are trying boss in a time medal. And technicallywe make sure we are on trackThen we continue putting short for to get back up a woman. So that is our consideration of whyFrom this semester, we would expect a project proposal to the summit early so that this will be helpful.  Trust meAnd for the general requirements for deliverable of this group project.  We have the deliverable, we have delivery deliverable of the group project is that? Right Yeah,  we are asking for this. So a project proposal to be summit on in week seven, this is definite. And in week 13 you need to be able to more or less finish the project.

其次，如果在你的项目中有任何现实或难以处理的事情，我们可以尽早发现，然后调整我们的方向。你没人想要最后，我不能完成它，然后在一个模块中得到不那么好的性能。然后在我们站起来帮助我们所有人之前提交提案以确保我们在努力老大在时间奖章上。而且技术上我们确保我们在轨道上。然后我们继续为了让一个女人重新振作起来。所以这就是我们考虑的原因。从这个学期开始，我们希望尽早向峰会提交一份项目提案，这样会有所帮助。相信我和为了一般要求为了可交付成果这个小组项目的。我们有可交付成果，我们有可交付成果小组项目的可交付成果是对的是的，这是我们自找的。那么项目提案将在第七周举行峰会，这是肯定的。在第13周你需要能够或多或少地完成这个项目。

And record the video, shoot to have your product, have your machine to be able to demonstrate to us to convince us that your productyour machine can work nicely. And also the work you have done is meaningful. It's useful. Okay Thenyeah, before we call and then in week 14, you need to write up the final reports,  and then you cannot start writing in the 14. You need to write you need to write you throughout the whole process. You can start right. Once you start your project,  then in addition to the video demonstration that to demonstrate the functionality and the meaning is and the meaning of your projects. And all you also to us also need to stop it final report and poster.

和录制视频，拍摄有你的产品，有你的机器可以向我们展示。让我们相信你的产品你的机器可以很好地工作。你所做的工作也是有意义的。它很有用。好的然后是的，在我们打电话之前，然后在第14周，你需要写最终报告，然后你不能在第14周开始写。你需要写你需要写作。你贯穿整个过程。你可以从右开始。一旦你开始你的项目，那么除了视频演示之外，还演示了功能和意义以及您的项目的意义。而所有你也对我们也需要阻止它。最终报告和海报。

So that other general requirements and in the next week, I will give you more detailed information on how you're going to how you are getting on with the project and what's really into the summit. And these are some general things that I tell you what you need to do Then on Top of that throughout the project period,  every member need to. Byebye. Pass and keep a logbook recording what you have done every day for that can contribute to the project a lot of so basically you would have AA lot of means a diary, something like a diary.  It records like February of yeah What are they today? February, 27th of February, what you have done, 28th of February, what we have doneAccording to your task allocation, I you need to keep a log book for everybody,  every two family to have this. So you must have an allocation. You must have a allocation of the workloada bunker to remember them, sort of part of the work you need to do, then you to take a record of what you have done for every day

所以另一个一般要求，在下周，我会给你更详细的信息，关于你将如何进行这个项目，以及什么是真正的峰会。这些是一些一般的东西。我告诉你你需要做什么然后在那之上整个项目期间每个成员都需要拜拜传球并保持航海日志记录你每天所做的事情，这可以为项目做出很多贡献，所以基本上你会有很多方法，比如日记。它记录的就像是的，二月他们今天是什么？2月27日，你们做了什么，2月28日，我们做了什么根据你的任务分配，我你需要为每个人保留一个日志，每两个家庭都有这个。所以你必须有一个分配。您必须有工作负载的分配一个掩体来记住它们，这是你需要做的工作的一部分，然后你要记录你每天所做的事情。

System, including what materials you have read and found the material, what ideas you have bought, you can take a recording. And if you have got any designfor number, say, for example, you design the electrical circuit,  you can sketch out a layout the second and also necessary calculations to determine every single component of the circuit. This can all be recorded in your notebook for the price This is somethingThis is something you need to recall. So basicallybasicallyevery single detail related to the part of the work you have done can be recorded on the law book, say for about that. So say, for example,  today 27 February,  I have read some papers, read some, textbooks read some web page reports, watch some videos, and then I got an idea on how this robot can be designed. Then you sketch out some nice pictures, right The next day you're going to detail design, rightThen you use some software and to design some components, then you can take a screen shot of your design and copy and paste it onto a lot of the next day, you are going to determine the size of the motor. You are going to drive the axis of the robot. OkayHow large the motor is You need to get the size of the motor by some calculation, then write down those calculation, then also record which motor you have selected, which supplier does this motor belongs to record everything,  something like this.

系统，包括你读过什么材料？找到了材料，你有什么想法，你可以买。录个音。如果你有任何设计对于数字，比如说，你设计电路，你可以画出第二个布局草图，也可以进行必要的计算来确定电路的每一个组件。这都可以记录在你的笔记本上就价格而言这是什么东西这是你需要回忆的事情。所以基本上基本上是每一个细节与你所做的工作相关的部分可以记录在法律书上，比如大约。比如说，今天2月27日，我读到了一些论文，读一些，课本读一些网页报告，观看一些视频，然后我对如何设计这个机器人有了一个想法。然后你画了一些漂亮的草图，对吗？第二天你要去详细设计，对吗？然后你使用一些软件，设计一些组件，然后你可以截屏。你的设计，并复制粘贴到很多第二天，你要确定马达的尺寸。你要驾驶机器人的轴。好的马达有多大？你需要通过一些计算得到电机的尺寸，然后写下这些计算，然后也记录你选择了哪个电机，这个电机属于哪个供应商，记录所有的东西，就像这样。

OkayRight? Again, we will talk about this in more detail in the next week. Thank you very much. Thank you.  Right These are the requirements for this module how this module organized. Basically, we have six classes and we have four classes only.  And then we have two lab sessions and all the remain of the semester you will be working on group project. And during the process of the group projects,  we will we will have 6 time where we can join us for tutorials. And in the tutorial sessions,  you can bring your work with you. And let us have a look and then ask us questions. And even meantime, we give you suggestions on how to do the I think it work exactly all the sort of thing that we need to do. And in the meantime, you also need to know what you need to summit for a good project. OkayRight. So and in a rightI will sayI I I give you 5 minutes for anyone who does not take the recording,  take the attendance record, you can do it againGive me 5 minutes, and then we start again on10, 23Just post office I can You have got to point it in this 5 minutes and we start again in 5 minutes Even in time, I will you can sign up to our code again. Nasa

好的对的？同样，我们将在下周更详细地讨论这个问题。非常感谢。谢谢对的这些是本模块的要求此模块的组织方式。基本上，我们有六节课，我们只有四节课。然后我们有两节实验课，这学期剩下的时间你们都会从事小组项目。在小组项目的过程中，我们将我们将有6个时间，我们可以加入我们的教程。在辅导课上，你可以带上你的作品。让我们有一个看，然后问我们问题。即使在此期间，我们也会为您提供有关如何执行我认为它确实有效所有我们需要做的事情。同时，你还需要知道一个好的项目需要什么。好的对的。那么而在一个对的我会说我给你5分钟，谁不拿录音，拿考勤记录，你可以再做一次。给我5分钟，然后我们重新开始10, 23, 只要邮局我就可以你必须在这5分钟内指出它，我们在5分钟内重新开始。即使到时候，我也会。您可以再次注册我们的代码美国太空总署
