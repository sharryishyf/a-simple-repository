Moment. And please note that this requirement is for last academic year. Ii checked out here. I I'm just to give you a general picture on how the group project I will be assessed, will be organized. And this document is started to update, and the update the document is now inside of the universities moderating process. And then before the moderation finished and II cannot just release it. So I just show you the last year's requirements. And for this state requirements, there will there will be little difference in between the requirements for this and the requirements for last year. So I just give you a document showing the requirements of last year and generallyfor both industrial projects and general projects, you need to summit the same as specified on the requirement document and apart from this requirement document, which will be the basisaccording to which you conduct your project, I give you another induction notes to trying to give you as much detail as possible how to go through your group projects step by step.

时刻。请注意，此要求仅适用于上一学年。我在这里检查过了。我只是想给你一个总图上我将如何对小组项目进行评估，将如何组织。开始更新此文档，现在更新文档大学内部的调节过程。然后在审核结束之前，我不能释放它。所以我只给你看去年的要求。对于这个州的要求，会有这方面的要求与去年的要求差别不大。所以我只是给你一份文件，显示去年的要求和一般要求。对于工业项目和一般项目，您需要满足与需求文档上指定的相同的要求，并且除了本需求文档之外，这将是基础根据你进行你的项目时，我给你另一份入职笔记。试着给你尽可能多的细节，如何一步一步地完成你的小组项目。

Right Let's first have a look at this description notes and to see what we will require for your group projectYou see Thank you so much I II will just quickly goes through this note because we don't have much time.  I just so quickly goes through the notes.  And to let the main components, which you need to sum it for your book project. OkaySo basically thought this book projects,  the requirement aspect on this document accounts for,  let's say, 65% of the module Mark accounts for 65% of the module bond that for this semester you also need to apart from this group project deliver both. You also need to summit a project proposal in week seven something and this will be accounting for another time percent. And so requirements as based on this document accounts for 65% of the total module Mark and for the detailed market distributionfor this part there will be two things.

对的让我们先来看看这个描述笔记，看看我们对你的小组项目有什么要求。你看非常感谢我会很快的因为我们没有太多的时间。我只是快速地浏览了一下笔记。并让主要组成部分，你需要为你的图书项目总结一下。好的所以基本上认为这本书的项目，这个文档上的需求方面占了，比如说，模块分数的65%。占本学期模块债券的65%，除了这个小组项目外，你还需要交付这两个。你还需要在一周内完成一份项目提案。七个左右，这将是另一个时间的解释。百分比。因此，基于本文件的要求占总模块标记的65%，详细市场分布对于这一部分会有两件事。

So firstly, you need to hand into us a project demonstration approaching the end of semester, let's say, usually in week 14, week 13, in week 13, you need to hand in the project demonstration which you have done. And for the project administration, basically, you need to submit a poster, you need to submit a poster and also a video about no more than 3 minutes That shows how your developed product can work With a poster and the video recording you need to you as a group need to give a presentation, you need to give a presentation, introducing your project and also using your video to demonstrate.

所以首先，你需要在学期快结束的时候交给我们一个项目演示，比如说，通常在第14周，第13周，在第13周，你需要交作业你所做的项目演示。和对于项目管理，基本上，您需要提交一个海报，您需要提交一张海报还有一段不超过3分钟的视频。这表明你的开发的产品可以工作有了海报和视频记录，你需要作为一个团队，你需要做一个演示，介绍你的项目。也用你的视频来演示。

So product some machine or the software you have developed can be fully functional.  So that's the first part.  This project demonstration with a poster with a video and also a presentation accounts for 60%60% of this group project part let's say this is detailed market criteria for each part of your project administration. And ideally, in your project demonstration, you need to introduce these few things. You need to introduce these few things. First Yeah,  for these parts Yeah, you can go through that first. Firstly,  you are working on a group project, you develop a product, you developed a certain kind of electronic system, a a machine, AAA device, an apparatus that is you mostly electronic devices, right

那么产品有些机器或你开发的软件可以功能齐全。这就是第一部分。这个项目演示有一张海报、一段视频和一个演示文稿，占60%。的60%这个小组项目部分让我们说这是项目管理各部分的详细市场标准。理想情况下，在您的项目演示中，您需要介绍这几件事。你需要介绍这几件事。第一是啊，为了这些地方。是的，你可以先通过那个。首先，你在做一个小组项目，你开发一个产品。你发展了一种电子系统，一种机器，一种设备，一种主要是电子设备的装置，对吗？

And also maybe you don't have any hardware, you develop a software, a software can also be a product, right? And the way you develop productsa machine, something which can be placed on the ground and to show us how it is work. So firstly,  you need to introduce to us the user needs and design requirements. What the user needs means why your product why your product is useful,  you need to demonstrate some succinct you have developed has the need, say, is the need on the market set for the product, for the machine, for the software, you develop there, the need on the market, you need to demonstrate this, you need to demonstrate this. That's the first thingAnd apart from this requirement, apart from the needs from the market,  there is something there are some needs in the market,  someone somebody needs your product according to these needs

还有也许你没有任何硬件，你开发一个软件，一个软件也可以是一个产品，对吗？以及你开发产品的方式一台机器，可以放在地上，向我们展示它是如何工作的。那么首先，你需要向我们介绍用户需求和设计要求。用户需要什么意味着为什么你的产品为什么你的产品有用，你需要证明你开发的一些简洁的有需要，说出来，就是市场上的需要。设置对于产品，对于机器，对于软件，你在那里开发，市场上的需求，你需要展示这个，你需要展示这个。这是第一件事。除了这个要求之外，除了市场的需求之外，市场上还有一些需求，有人根据这些需求需要你的产品。

Then when you understand, when you're trying to when you as a design group, let's say, as a design group trying to understand the needs, there must be then in the end, you will be working out somewhere Design requirements, let's say, also design requirements also means design specification.

然后当你理解，当你试图当你作为一个设计团队，让我们说，作为一个设计团队试图理解需求时，最终必须有你。会在某个地方锻炼。设计要求，也就是说，设计要求也意味着设计规范。

And later on,  I will show you what a design specification is. Basically some technical data, some technical specifications Yeah, so I I think we can make some notes, right And in case that later on, you forgot.  Right Basically,  so I'm just saying so now I'm just telling you what you need to show to us for your project. No matter you're working on industrial project or general project, you are doing the same thing. Okay What you need to show Hold onLet me use a larger characters I don't know What about? So he was a 70s, right? Thank you. Sit down, please shut up. First of all, NASAIf you need to their demands online data.  It hurtsSo there is some demand, some requirements from the markets. And which motivates you to do this thing. Right? OkayTime for a group If I do this You will have the team never work alone, right? Can you understand. What comesDivide the finalIt is a real problem. It is a real problems such as specifications It's something just so what is the specification, for example, uh for a robot for robot, uh, the maximum traveling speed is like

稍后，我将向您介绍什么是设计规范。基本上是一些技术数据，一些技术规格是的，所以我我想我们可以做些笔记，对吗？万一以后，你忘了对的基本上，我只是说，现在我只是告诉你，你需要为你的项目向我们展示什么。不管你是在工业项目上工作或者一般的项目，你在做同样的事情。好的你需要展示的东西坚持让我使用较大的字符我不知道关于什么？所以他是70年代的，对吗？谢谢。坐下，请闭嘴。首先美国太空总署如果你需要他们的要求在线数据很疼所以有一些需求，一些来自市场的要求。和哪一激励你去做这件事。对的？好的一组的时间如果我这么做。你会让团队永远不会单独行动，对吗？你能吗了解什么来了分决赛这是一个真正的问题。这是一个真正的问题，如规格。这是一些东西，那么规格是什么，例如，机器人的机器人，
