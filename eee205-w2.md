And each how I block also connected to the style of locks for 45 blocks can be usedI think what are used as output, so which type experience is determined by the program of your programmer are promoted very similar to getBut the main difference licenseFor a girl, we only have an annual rate. We have an already and we are we provide this kind of race in parallel, and then we can process the different combinations of securityBut for security, we use the international violenceDon't have a guess why we need international one What's the use of the professional modelsThe real differenceWe are similar to fail Have take review of the council. Why do we need a professional modeBut because for a simple annual rate, can only be used to process a limited number of variables by to win.

而我的每一块又是如何连接到锁的样式。对于45个块可以使用我认为什么被用作输出，那么哪种类型的经验是由你的程序员的程序被提升了。与GET非常相似但主要的区别是执照对一个女孩来说，我们只有年费。我们已经有了，我们是我们提供这种并行的比赛，然后我们可以处理安全的不同组合。但为了安全，我们使用国际暴力不要猜测为什么我们需要国际的。专业模特有什么用？真正的区别我们都类似于失败必须接受理事会的审查。为什么我们需要专业模式？但因为对于一个简单的年率，只能用来处理有限的几个变量。由去赢。

For example, if we have function,  Sorry, with 35 points, a couple gap to so to calculate the perception of 25 lifetimesWe can transfer that the calculation of these time variables to another power law This transfer is conflicted by the international works the main usage of these intellectuals and that we can transfer the signal from one color block to another.  We can combine the preparation of the different and other different parts of the color blocks.  and we can combine together to formulate to calculate a larger example That's the reason why we need to catch a whileAlso, these are blocks also Connected provide the international levels In this caseSo into signal for accounting, for this power throughout the input signal is not limited. We only entered using this idolWe can also use this Iowa to enter some signals, and the signals can be used to pass into this population The interpretation wiresAnother issue of greatIf you have to signal communicate in different parts of the sit down, professionals In some cases, we also call this the interconnection architectureWhat's your favorite sample? We call this IA to a stand for a factory This is the internal structure for power blockFor each kind of like blog includes multiple Micro cellsWe get our signal to that we have olncBut for security, for each color block, we also have to Mark themselves For each color block, typically have 1616 Micro cellsAnd each Micro sale is composed and already first at input site just and operate.

例如，如果我们有函数，对不起，用35点，一对夫妇的差距所以要计算25的感知寿命我们可以把这些时间变量的计算另一个幂律这次转移是与国际工程的冲突这些知识分子的主要用途是，我们可以将信号从一个色块传递到另一个色块。我们可以结合准备不同的和其他不同部分的色块。我们可以结合在一起。制定计算一个更大的例子这就是为什么我们需要赶一段时间的原因。而且，这些也是块连接的提供国际水平在这种情况下所以对于入信号进行核算，对于此功率整个输入信号是不受限制的。我们只用这个神像进入。我们也可以用这个衣阿华输入一些信号，信号可以用来传递到这个种群中。解释线另一期伟大的如果你必须在坐下来的不同地方发信号交流。专业人士在某些情况下，我们也将其称为互连架构你最喜欢的样品是什么？我们称这个为工厂的展台。这是Power Block的内部结构因为每一类博客都包含多个微单元。我们得到我们的信号，我们有OLNC但为了安全起见，对于每个色块，我们也要自己标记。对于每个色块，通常有16个16个微型电池以及每个微销售是沉着的并且已经首先在输入站点上进行操作。

Okay At the later side, we also have some programmer of the logic annual rate plus the practical logic will lead to a marked concept Here we have an array We can use this structure to produce the sop. Are you remember the sum of products using this and our room can produce any kind of large functions within the sop force. RightAnd for first devicethis is a multiplexerThis is not the correctionThe output of the annual rate is back into this much larger and multiplexer can be used to switch between the company form and non company formAgain, not a quick question. Why do we need to use not come from form and comment for,  why do we need to switch in the for why we need this multiplexer at this stageThe same as a hell of we have two different standard expressions for large functions, the first sop and second QS

好的在后期，我们还有一些逻辑年率加的编程器。实践逻辑将导致一个有标记的概念这里我们有一个数组我们可以用这个。结构来生产SOP, 是吗记住乘积的总和。使用这个和我们的房间可以在SOP Force中产生任何类型的大型功能对的以及用于第一设备这是一个多路复用器这不是更正。年率的输出回到这个大得多的多路复用器可以用来在公司形式和非公司形式之间切换再说一次，不是一个简短的问题。为什么我们需要使用不是来自表单和注释，为什么我们需要在为什么我们在这个阶段需要这个多路复用器和地狱一样对于大型函数，我们有两个不同的标准表达式，第一个SOP和第二个QS

The output of this terminal is sop We can use the countthe custom form of the sob to invert the structure into the POS for That's the function of the first of action Then the output of the first multiplexer is back into a foot blockIt's actually the second amount of pressureThis is used to switch between the output of an array and output of the third floorYou can imagine for a girl is a similar to switch between the combination of mode and the register. All rightThe output of the annual rate effect into flip flop. And if the amount of practice likes the cube outputthat's the rejection of the multiplexer selects the upper side input that will be directly output from an over, in this case, can be used as a combination And for the third device this is a tri state buffer This practical perform the basic of the logic of these devicesWhen the program enable is highthis price, the buffer will be connectedIn this case, this is active high as the bufferI can hear thatWe do not have a bubble at the end of triangle.  This is at high deviceAn occupied device means there are soBut the same the import for the customerIf the program will be fineif program remote high. But indeedbecause that is connected The output of the body practices, the second of the texture will be used as OPPO. In that case, if the practical input is highthe iop will be automatically set at outputwill be used as optimal This is not defined by usersFpga is PLD is automatically site if you have entered a program unable to be highfpgm or the countries automatically set the corporations to set this opinion could be output They were from football is low. Right? In this casethe trusted buffer is disconnectedIt's disconnected In this case, the iop will be automatic concept as an inputAgain, this is step by pl DS The users only need to enter the program level signal to perform whether it's slow or zero or it's zero or one so that you will decide all internal perform for you If the program is equal to zerothe first buffer is disconnected. So we have two IRight?  We have two eyesThese two terminals have different purpose When the program evil is noand see this first eyes can be used to achieve the input signalsThe second I, the equal signal has heard from this I. All right In this casethe first I is used carry signal from the entire circuitfrom the compositional output or the justice output This is when program angle is zero when the programming model is oneit's one

该终端的输出为SOP我们可以用伯爵用于将结构转换为POS的SOB的自定义表单这就是第一个行动的作用。则返回第一多路复用器的输出变成一个脚块。它实际上是第二个压力量。这是用过的在数组输出和第三层输出之间切换你可以想象对于一个女孩来说是多么的相似。在模式组合之间切换还有登记簿好吧年率效应的产出变成人字拖。如果练习量喜欢立方体输出那就是拒绝多路复用器选择上侧输入在这种情况下，将直接从OVER输出，可以用作组合并且对于第三设备这是一个三态缓冲器这实际执行这些设备的逻辑的基础当程序使能为高时这个价格，缓冲器将被连接这种情况下，缓冲器为高电平有效。我能听到。我们在三角形的末端没有气泡。这是在高设备上被占用的设备是指有这么多但对客户来说进口是一样的。如果程序没问题如果程序远程高但确实因为这是有联系的。身体练习的输出，第二个纹理就会用到。作为OPPO。在这种情况下，如果实际输入较高IOP将在输出时自动设置将被用作最佳这不是用户定义的FPGA是PLD，是自动站点，如果你已经输入了程序，无法被高。FPGM或国家自动设置公司设置此意见可以输出他们来自足球是低的对的？在这种情况下受信任缓冲区已断开连接断线了在这种情况下，IOP将是作为输入的自动概念同样，这是PL DS的步骤用户只需要输入程序级信号来执行它是慢还是零，或者它是零还是一，这样你就可以决定所有的内部执行。给你的如果程序等于零断开第一缓冲器。所以我们有两个I对的？我们有两只眼睛。这两个终端有不同的用途当邪恶的程序是不而这第一眼看到的就是可以用来实现的输入信号。第二个我，相等的信号从这个我那里听到了。好吧在这种情况下第一个I用于进位信号从整个电路从组合输出或公正输出这是当程序角度为零时当编程模型为1时是一个

The first buffer is connected. In this case, the two ih carry the same signal The two areas carry signal, same signal from the. That's it, too That's a different function for eyesYou just remember close to I, for the first to I. It always carries a signal from an already and from the recent mode or the conditional mode For the second to Ithe signal type hands on the condition for program was made. It is highIt's kind of the same signal to the first to ra. It is slowIf carry a signal from this, I will take into this is a master cell inside the cprd. Any questions so far for this by conceptIt's quite similar to the operation for againAny questions so far? No Thank you The Top view for the cprd As I say, and we can see for each how I block we have become 16 Micro cellsBut in this case The entire Top and contributes to AA single Mark concept

连接第一缓冲器。在这种情况下，两个IH携带相同的信号两个区域携带信号，相同的信号来自也是这样这对眼睛来说是不同的功能。你只需记住接近I，即第一个到I。它总是携带来自已经和最近模式或条件模式的信号。为我的第二个制定了信号类型交接的程序条件。它很高这和第一个到RA的信号是一样的它很慢如果携带信号由此，我将带进这是CPRD内部的主电池。到目前为止，对这个概念有什么问题吗？这与Again的操作非常相似。到目前为止有什么问题吗？不谢谢CPRD的俯视图正如我所说，我们可以看到，对于每一个我如何阻止，我们已经变成了16个微细胞。但在这种情况下整个上衣并有助于AA单标记概念

But for the real city of you can have multiple market salesThis is the Basic Law.  We have multiple Micro cellsIn this case, we have displayed 12, 33 100,000 Iop can be used as inputas long as we can set the prostate buffer that can translate into the Europe In this case, transformer is this market for theseIo P's will be used as a people Some of you may have fun We then slight difference in this structure with previous oneThe main difference is, in the first figure, we have a multiplexer one. RightBut in this structurewe use an export gamereplace them up to one interesting to think about itWhy it happensI can tell these two spectra is different, say. So why we can replace the multiplexer onebuilding this xokTake me to think about itBefore it's okayWhat's the logic of thisContextual gates were output oneWhen two students are different. Byebye In this case, in this stage,  it's okay.  This is the input.

但对于真正的城市，你可以有多个市场销售。这是基本法。我们有多个微型细胞。在本例中，我们显示了12，33 100，000IOP可用作输入只要我们能设置可以翻译到欧洲的前列腺缓冲剂在这种情况下，变压器是这个市场的这些IO P s将被用作人员你们中的一些人可能会很开心。然后，我们在这个结构中与以前的结构略有不同主要区别是，在第一个图中，我们有一个多路复用器。对的但在这个结构中我们使用出口游戏最多更换一个想想很有趣。为什么会发生我可以说这两个光谱是不同的所以为什么我们可以更换多路复用器1构建这个XOK带我去考虑一下。在没事之前这是什么逻辑？上下文门输出为1当两个学生不一样时拜拜在这种情况下，在这个阶段，这是好的。这是输入

It's okay. And another input is connected to an beforeThat's okay. The first is the input to exogate and another is the output from the annual rate That's the definition. If the input to xok is oneand output of this panel gate is zeroWho will be the resultIt will be one, rightThe two different signals has its aim to, so gate will produce one, a high level voltage If the input is one and xo onethere are output zero. Right What do you can see hereIt just works like emergencyIt produces the company forms at the output of the NRA. Byebye This is used for this. It's okayAgainif the input it's okay in zerozero xo zero, which is zerozero. Xo one produces more 1In this casethe output of the panel array remains the same I will open.  It remains same to the output of the end of rain

没关系。和另一个输入连接到以前没关系。第一个是Exogate的输入，另一个是年率的输出。这就是定义。如果XOK的输入为1且该面板门输出为零结果会是谁？会是一个，对吧？这两个不同的信号有其目的，所以门将产生一个高电平电压如果输入为1且XO为1有输出零对的你能在这里看到什么？它只是就像紧急情况一样它产生公司形成在输出端全国步枪协会的拜拜这个是用来做这个的。没关系又如果输入零度是可以的零XO零即零零。XO一号生产更多 1, 在这种情况下面板阵列的输出保持不变我会打开的。它与雨末的输出保持不变

So that means we can create we can use an episode gatereplace this multiplexer. Hi We can just enter a control scene of the one or 01 means the output of an already well be inverted.  It's a common problemIf the input to it's already is, the xok is zero and produces the nothing company pointIt works a similar to the previous house package into the in reality we prefer instructor We prefer to places the multiplexer reading these large pricesnot okay, because the calculation, the processing time for these large gates is much more faster than multiple actions You can just imagine this quite similar to the programA multi factor is very much like you are using a gift structure Every time you putI guess to do the count is, wellmake the questions much more complex.  Right? You're running time will be increased and then the same commission for this one. It's not a lot of belong in byebye

所以这意味着我们可以创造我们可以用一集门。代替这个多路复用器嗨我们可以只输入一个控制场景的1或01，这意味着输出已经很好地被反转了。这是一个常见的问题。如果它的输入已经是，则xok为零，并产生Nothing公司点。它的工作原理类似于把以前的房子打包成实际上我们更喜欢教师我们更喜欢放置多路复用器来读取这些大价格不好，因为计算，这些大型门的处理时间比多个动作要快得多。你可以想象这与程序非常相似。多因素很像你在使用礼物结构。每次你把我想数数是，好吧让问题变得更加复杂。对的？你的跑步时间将会增加，然后这一次的佣金是一样的。这不是很大的归属。拜拜

But you can talk about county.  That's all about the cpld for this content to the next we'll talk about LPG. But teacher is quite different from those that cpldsspl DS, because for security and spld, the large functions are generated based on the logic expressions we use an adult rate to express some large functions. All rightWe have feasible link or the electronic search it as well as herewe use a different way to express these lots of things because it's not a table It made it different like the scale of skld, the best part, the basic devices,  the basis structure is an array, apgaThe basic component is for the program, for logic blocks These white blocks is the Cr DS group of block blocksAnd interconnections are available between these This is used to enlarge the population when the Bible is limited and combined out of different Cr BS and only a larger circuit that's why we need these interactions

但你可以谈论县。这就是关于CPLD的全部内容，接下来我们将讨论LPG。但是老师很不一样。从那些CPLDSSPL DS，因为为了安全和SPLD，产生了大的功能基于逻辑表达式我们使用成人价格来表达一些大的函数。好吧我们有可行的链接或电子搜索吗？以及这里我们用不同的方式来表达这些东西，因为它不是一张表。它成功了不同于SKLD的规模，最好的部分，基本设备，基本结构是一个阵列，APGA基本组件用于程序，用于逻辑块这些白色块是Cr DS块组并且它们之间可以互连。这是用来扩大人口的。当圣经是有限的，并结合了不同的Cr BS，只有一个更大的电路这就是为什么我们需要这些互动。

Again, the Cr BS are surrounded by our blocksYou can see this is very similar to the cprd. And the only difference in difference is now we are using aclb that we are. Now you can see all these replays and all the way to express what options This is structure for control of block and sell itshall be well used to look up cable approach to generate any large functionsIn this case, they support the truth table based approach to be a full functionWe have two different ways to to express it. Right? The first so that we can write down the logical functions like what we have done in now because shall we have fixed one ox two and all and three or four and we have been vitalsBut we have these functions and we design something based on these large functions and how many end gates we need, how many targets we needIs this the end of the race, this quartersthe bullying expression based approach

再一次，Cr B被我们的街区包围你可以看到这与CPRD非常相似。和唯一的区别是我们现在使用的是ACLB。现在你可以看到所有这些回放和所有表达选项的方式。这是结构为了控制块并卖掉它应很好地用于查找电缆方法，以生成任何大型功能在这种情况下，它们支持基于真值表的方法成为一个完整的功能我们有两种方法来表达它。对的？第一个这样我们就可以写下逻辑函数。就像我们现在所做的一样，因为我们已经修复了一头牛，两头牛，三头或四头牛，我们已经是重要的了。但我们有这些功能，我们根据这些大功能设计一些东西，我们需要多少个端门，我们需要多少个目标。这个季度的比赛到此结束了吗？基于欺负表达的方法

But for afpj is a truthful placeis that we don't need to is why exactly It looks good questions for the cl BS. Instead, we just probably need to choose themSo you can use the truth table to copy these two tables into the cl. And the cl be, well, percent of the speculation is based on this lot of people approach

但对AFPJ来说是一个真实的地方。我们不需要这就是为什么对于CL BS来说，这看起来是个不错的问题。相反，我们可能只需要选择它们。所以你可以用真值表将这两个表复制到CL中。而CL是，好的，推测的百分比是基于很多人的方法。

Going to sell their stores and entry of the two stableThe first 120 What we need to do is to copy output, to copy the output, to table into the storage stuff is 1001, and come back into the storage cells, 1001But please know that they stole themselves. They are not memory.  Actually, the delaythe moment of the electionDo you still remember lots of dh? NoSo how we are seeing that later, if you actually generally receives a flock signal to activate the functionWhenever it received the clock signal, either the rising age of third ageonce some detail will be passed into the delay and deluxe will store that dataAnd at an extra cyclethe store data will be removed to the next one. If that's AP latchwe will see that laterBut what do you need to know is this ourselves, they're not memoryThat will be much

打算卖掉他们的商店和进入两个马厩第一个120我们需要做的是复制输出，将输出复制到表中，存储内容为1001，并返回到存储单元1001但请记住他们偷了自己。它们不是记忆。实际上，延迟选举的时刻你还记得很多DH吗？不所以我们稍后会看到，如果你实际上通常会收到一个群体信号激活该功能每当它接收到时钟信号时，要么是上升期，要么是第三期一旦一些细节将被传递到延迟和豪华将存储该数据并在一个额外的周期存储数据将被删除到下一个。如果那是AP锁存器我们稍后会看到。但你需要知道的是，这是我们自己，它们不是记忆。那就太多了。

And for this choose to gowe have X twoX two is actually called the least significant gain This is lsbAnd X one with SB the most significant day to copy these two signal into the lock, we're going to do is first copy this output to the storage cells. And next copy the lsb to the first point, LC to the first calling of the multiple lecturesAnd msb to the last volume of the multi factors that will help us to configure a cle Basically, crp is some directionAnd combined with an array of the multiple pressures how we can enter the truth ago, hence the LC and amnesty and that we can copy these bibles into different parts, the lsb to the first layer of multiplexers and the msb to the last layer of this multi factors. If we have another Bible in between the variables, it will be used to get up into the interactions

为此选择离开我们有X个二X 2实际上被称为最不重要的增益这是LSB和X一和某人在一起最重要的一天要将这两个信号复制到锁中，我们要做的是首先将此输出复制到存储单元。还有下一个复制LSB到第一点LC, 到第一个呼叫多个讲座的和MSB到最后一卷的多因素这将帮助我们配置一个CLE基本上，CRP是某种方向并结合了多个压力的阵列我们如何才能进入真理之前，因此LC和大赦，我们可以复制这些圣经到不同的部分，LSB到第一层多路复用器和MSB到这个多因素的最后一层。如果我们有另一本圣经在变量之间，它将被用来进入交互

So that's how important these people into the locksNow we can see how that's true.  A lot to operate, especially stableThe first half check was too stableThe output is one only when two input signals are same. RightWe need to find this is actually it's not okay.  This is not good Let's first check the first row. Okay? First of allwe have X two equals to zero X one equals to zero This is the schematic function for these multi party when the data slide control is zeroit will select upper side of the input is zeroWhen the control signal is one, it will select the lower part of entry.  What There was next episode and one select the lower side Now us back to this lot for first falling off in my practice, 0Select upper side,  the output is zeroFor the first of lecture zeroBut that's like to get a zero.  It's like emphasize. Byebye. 1 for the last layer of this last lecture, the data section to get zero it will select episode

这就是这些人进锁的重要性。现在我们可以看到这怎么会是真的。操作很多，特别稳定前半部分检查太稳定了。输出为1仅当两个输入信号相同时对的我们需要找到这实际上是不好的这可不好。让我们先检查一下第一排好的？首先我们有x2等于零。X 1等于0这是这些多方的示意功能当数据滑动控制为零时它将选择输入为零的上侧当控制信号为1时，它将选择入口的较低部分什么有下一集和一个选择较低的一面现在我们回到这个地方，在我的实践中第一次掉下来。0, 选择上侧，输出为零第0课的第一课但那就像得零分一样。就像强调一样拜拜1, 对于最后一讲的最后一层，数据部分得到零它将选择插曲

What's the output for the 001This is how these two people can be stored in people's lives We can check another exampleSecond rowX one is zero X two is one There's a selection for this month class is one. It was selected the lower part, rightThe output of this month passage oneoutput for this one question is zero For this month's lecture they don't start to signal zero. It will select the upper sideHow to say that?  What will be zero by which the second volume and the third point 101It's 101,  zero select the upper side is 01, and one select lower side into up to 10similar to the last four for classroom 101, ok My pleasure was slack The lower side01 the last one select the upper sidealso for lower side that selection of one and it asks what

输出是什么？对于001这两个人就是这样被储存在人们的生活中的。我们可以检查另一个例子。第二排X 1为零X二是一这个月有一个选课，课程是一个。它被选中了下半部分，对吗？这个月的产量此问题的输出为零为了这个月的讲座它们不会开始发出零信号。它将选择上侧怎么说呢？什么会是零？其中第二卷第三点呢？101, 它是101，零选择上面是01，一选择下侧最多可插入10类似于最后四个101教室，好的。我的快乐是懒散的。下侧01最后一个选择上侧还用于下侧选择一个且它问什么

This is basically the principle for a lot. We store how of the choose table into this sort of cells We transfer the lsb and transport lsb to the first layer of the mouth dancer and amnesty, the last name of my classroom that we can offer. That's interesting Again, a lot usually have 4 to 5 inputIn this case, we only have two variablesTwo variables were by four star sales4, 11 over 54 story cells is the power of twotwo of the number of the products What if we have larger? We have more bibles You can do these connection switchesWe are combined output of different large blocks. And now we can actually, for a larger circle And here's another example How this law can be usedBut in this example, we are using a lot to complain. I'm not actuallyWhat are you doing this to keep yourselves? You can touch a lot of pressureThe multiplexer will have three improve bibles to inform with much pressure and another is big as that control involved

这基本上是很多人的原则。我们储存怎样将选择表转换为这类单元格。我们转移LSB，并将LSB传输到第一层口舞者和特赦，我教室的最后一个名字。我们可以提供的那很有趣同样，很多通常有4到5个输入在这种情况下，我们只有两个变量两个变量是四星级销售。411超过54层细胞是2的幂产品数量的两个如果我们有更大的呢？我们有更多的圣经你可以这些连接开关我们是不同大块的组合输出。现在我们可以。实际上，对于一个更大的圆圈和这是另一个例子如何使用这条法律但在这个例子中，我们用了很多来抱怨。实际上我不是你们这样做是为了什么？你可以接触到很多压力。多路复用器将具有三个改进圣经在很大的压力下提供信息，另一个是很大的控制。

Who can generate a true stable hereIn this case, we have three in providers. Let's say we are need eight for themselvesEngland is such a lotsuch a function.  I'm sure that you said that we found when the data start control signal is zerothe out of the opposite of equal to the signal a equal to signal case when is equal to zero. It selects emphasize when it has the control is one out of Z equal to B one BWhen data set concludes one and slammed the lower side The first thing you generate 20, and you copy these entries up entries into these sorts of 0011010100110101 B is at leastAnd S. Thank you so muchIs the most complicated nsd You call it a messy to the first calling of the the mmsk to the last volume of the market factors

谁能在这里创造一个真正的稳定？在本例中，我们有三个提供程序。假设我们自己需要八个人英格兰太多了。这样的功能。我确信你说过我们发现当数据开始控制信号为零时。与之相反的等于信号A等于零时，等于信号情况它选择强调当它有控制的时候是一个在Z中等于B的一个B当数据集结束时，一个和猛击下侧第一件事是你生成20，然后你把这些条目复制到0011010100110101中。B是至少是和S非常感谢是最复杂的NSD, 你把它叫做第一次呼叫的混乱。的MMSK是市场最后的成交量因素。

Lc for the first volume of the normal pressures and the remaining signal input signal aSo I think the train across the and medicine you have to check for this function.  So then S at equals to 101101 to this point P equals to oneThat means all datas are controlled for first layer of the small access, not only one For this one question, slacksupper side,  sorry, the lower sideIn your side, it was X oneIn this caseone is 10And for the second layerthe data control is controlled by signal a, in this case, a equals zero It was select upper side. In this case, it's one side zero. All rightFor the last layer gave us like control signal is one X, rightAs well select lower sideIts lower side is one, the output would be one Is 101The output will be one This is how we can store such sustainable into this ipj into this law

LC, 对于正常压力的第一个体积和剩余信号输入信号A所以我认为火车穿越了医学。你必须检查这个功能。那么接下来S AT等于101101到这一点P等于1这意味着所有的数据都被控制在小访问的第一层，而不仅仅是一个对于这一个问题，休闲裤上面，对不起，下面在你那边，是X 1在这种情况下一个是10而对于第二层数据控制由信号A控制，在这种情况下，A等于零它是选择上侧。在这种情况下，它的一边是零好吧对于最后一层给我们的控制信号是一个X，对吧？同时选择下侧如果它的下边是1，输出就是1。是101输出将为1这就是我们如何将这种可持续的存储到IPJ中，存储到法律中。

Okay? So you may check for the other rowsBasically, it defines how we can fetch some data from this.  Thank you so muchBut so far we have seen how we read from this lineprobably from the vjrcis But before we can read from these data, we first need to write the station into this one. Right How can we achieve the function? How can we achieve the right function As I said, this sort of cells that actually the de latch 3 feet, actuallyIn this case, we can,  in contrast, decoder in front of these themselves for the function of the drastic order that can generate some plus signalsbaby like in this case, we have eggs ourselves, so it has eight positions to generate these clock signalblock signal 0007

好的？所以你可以检查其他行。基本上，它定义了我们如何从中获取一些数据。非常感谢但到目前为止，我们已经看到了我们如何从这条线上阅读。可能来自VJRCIS但在读取这些数据之前，我们首先需要将站点写入这个站点。对的如何才能实现功能？如何才能实现正确的功能？就像我说的，这个一种实际上是DE闩锁的细胞实际上是3英尺在这种情况下，我们可以相反地，解码器在前面这些本身为函数的剧烈的顺序，可以产生一些正信号像婴儿一样在这种情况下，我们自己有鸡蛋，所以它有八个位置来产生这些时钟信号封锁信号0007

For these eggs themselves, we need to create some addressesthe address we need to create from, we have eight dressesThat means we are need 3 days. All rightWe use three basic a signal from 000111. Did you have a from 0 to 87% of the right. There are 7 hours, the implied address conditions for these serbies, for these elections For this address the cooler, it also have the right handle Only when right enable is high, the plastic corner can be used to getting some plus signals Let's say we have first we have address to be 000 The dress 000 generate some plot signal at the first positionack zero. So CK zero here are some flux signals and this term In this casethe first sale, the first election will be activatedbecause there are some plus signals transferred into this image will be enabled

对于这些鸡蛋本身，我们需要创建一些地址。我们需要创建的地址，我们有八件衣服那意味着我们需要3天。好吧我们使用来自000111的三个基本A信号你有没有从0到87%对的。有7个小时，隐含地址这些的条件塞比斯，为了这些选举对于这个地址的冷却器，它也有正确的处理。只有当RIGHT ENABLE为高电平时，塑料边角才能用于获得一些正信号让我们说我们有第一个我们有地址为000衣服000在第一位置产生一些绘图信号确认为零。所以CK为零这里有一些通量信号和此项在这种情况下第一次出售，第一次选举将被激活。因为有一些正信号传输到该镜像中，所以将启用

At the same time, we need to prepare Here is to take off with the first answer should be zeroYou need to copy these entries into the law The first entry is zero.  We need to prepare a zero after data into this input to these themselves The first equal to zero, and the dress cooler, a clock signal appears at the first address The zero will be written into the first for itselfAnd nextafter the signal is passed into soft cell, we need to continue to the next address. The next is 001 before 0018relates to the second store itself hereThe best is 001Another clock signalNow here at the input of the second electionthe second intellectual of the activity At the same time, we need to prepare the data zero and based in input. And this zero will be topic into the second entrySimilarly, to the thirdwe have 010, 010 refers to this C RB for this.

同时，我们需要做好准备。这里是起飞的第一个答案应该是零。你需要把这些条目复制到法律中。第一个条目为零。我们需要准备一个零，然后把这些数据输入到这个里面。第一个等于零，并且在服装冷却器中，时钟信号出现在第一个地址处零将被写入其自身的第一个还有下一个在信号被传递到软单元之后，我们需要继续到下一个地址。下一个是001, 0018之前与这里的第二个商店本身有关。最好的是001另一个时钟信号现在在这里输入第二次选举活动的第二个知识分子同时，我们需要准备数据。零和基于输入。这个零将是主题进入第二个条目同样，到第三个我们有010，010指的是这个。C用于此的RB

Yeah, actuallySo another course,  generally, on this addressthank you. This is 010.  The dress for this intellectual is a 10 We need to prepare a one at the data in this one can be passed into a thirst on seven. This is how we can write the true, stableright? Or too stable intoThat's ourselvesAnd to find any questionsIt just remember, just cooler it to be used to generate some customers. OkayEach store itself will be connectedSome plus signalsAnd whenever the input storage sales appears on Top signalsThe data can be written into the corresponding themselves Byebye This is the museum of how we can use at PGA is to carry some kind of national large functions to this slide and showing me to this apology for the teacher In this sample The touch function is to possess F equals to F one or X two and F one equals two

是的，事实上所以另一门课，一般来说，在这个地址上谢谢你们。这是010。这个知识分子的衣服是10我们需要准备一个。在中的数据这个可以通过。变成了七点的口渴。这就是我们写作的方式。真实，稳定是吧？或者太稳定了那是我们自己并找到任何问题。它只是记住，只是冷却它。用来产生一些客户。好的每个商店本身都将被连接起来。一些加号信号无论何时输入存储销售显示在顶部信号上可以将数据写入相应的自身拜拜这是我们如何在PGA使用的博物馆是为了承载某种国家大型功能。这张幻灯片，给我看这个为老师道歉在这个样本中触摸功能是拥有F等于F 1或X 2和F 1等于2

X one X two, and F two. It comes to not X two and X three What we do in apga is actually a deep composed the entire functionNo parking function is oneIf you are not to ask me. Byebye. If you can come from thatwhen we use the first law. First first, they are being processed explosionsAnd another shall be processedNow it's two and X three and the third crb profess have one of that's how we can process these combination of surveysFirst, for F one, induction tables for F one you can see a, it's a simple end game. For chicken, it's not X two and X three.  The output will be one only when X two equals to zero and X three one of last function is just okay This is how the function can be processed.

X一X二，F二。它不是X二和X三。我们在APGA中所做的实际上是整个功能的深度组合。无停车功能为一如果你不问我拜拜如果你能从那里来当我们使用第一定律时第一首先，他们正在处理爆炸。另一个应进行处理现在是2和X 3和第三个CRB表白有一个这就是我们如何处理这些调查的组合。首先，对于F一，归纳表对于F一你可以看到，这是一个简单的结束游戏。对于鸡肉来说，它不是X 2和X 3。仅当X 2等于0且X 31时，输出才为1最后一个功能还可以。这是如何处理函数。

A function is actually connected inside pm in this figure is blue switchindicate that the switch is dependent on In reality, you don't need to define how these bridges are configured All you need to do is to write a code like as equals to a 1 or 2 and 1+1 and 2 and 2 equals to this question. All you need to is answer this expressionsfpj as well, help me to configure internal structureIn this case, let's check The third function, F one as a function of X one, X two We have X one at the input of this. Are you paying? So it can be passed into crb along thisalong this route. Thank youTo remember whenever is a group of blue switch, we can turn aroundYou can turn right to left. We have the 3 groupsAnd X twoit's too similar, can be passed into the passed into F one because of things.

函数实际上是连接的。在PM内部图中为蓝色开关指示该开关依赖于实际上，您不需要定义如何配置这些网桥。所有你需要做的就是写一个代码，如等于1或2和1+1和2和2等于这个问题。你只需要回答这些问题FPJ也是，帮帮我。配置内部结构在这种情况下，让我们检查一下第三个函数，f 1是X 1，X 2的函数我们有X个1在这个的输入上。你付钱吗所以它可以是传递到CRB沿着这个沿着这条路线谢谢记住无论何时都是一组蓝色的开关，我们可以转身。你可以从右转到左。我们有三组。和X二它太相似了，可以传入传递到F 1因为事情

And 52the first input X two we. Now hellocortex to be transfer along these tracksThese two parts two can be processed into the second 70 Now there is X three, X three, and at this pointafter this outingin case it can be transferred We have Blue Cross. So we turn right to cross another group loss. So what we need to do is to collect this food process as for third crbthe first input is F one one. F one is output for the first cell.  If onewe passed all these 15 as a two is the output of the second lawBut after and transferred this routine This is how these interaction wires will be configured to income such a lot of functions We need some up signals, right?

和52第一个输入X 2我们现在你好皮质至是转让沿着这些轨道这两个部分二可以加工成第二个70现在有X 3，X 3，在这一点上在这次郊游之后如果可以转移的话。我们有蓝十字。所以我们右转过马路。又一次集团亏损。所以我们要做的就是收集这个食物的过程。至于第三个CRB第一个输入是F 11。对于第一个单元，输出1如果一个我们通过了所有这些15因为2是第二定律的输出但之后并被转移这个套路这就是这些交互连线的配置方式收入这么多的功能。我们需要一些信号，对吧？

So output of the search out you will be. But back I will be a wreck, will be wrecked by users Signal can be transferred to this iopIn this casewhich are opening in the output OutAnd all these three, have you been This is how this people can use to process a computational circuit. Of coursethat issue is not limited to some conventional association. And also you understand the special circuits We have known that to process some suspicious signals. We need a good plot It's similar to the cpld. We need to add a flip flop to generate some registered outputThat's a special stuff in book. Okay We can use a flip flop to be included into internal structure of apgm Here is a lotJust in the cpl is just replaced by an alreadyIt's the same function as a panel alreadya form of PG, we are entering some choose table to stress model companies.

这样输出的搜索结果就出来了。但是回来后，我将是一个破坏者，将被用户破坏信号可以传输到此IOP在这种情况下在输出中打开外出还有这三个。你有没有这就是为什么人们可以使用处理计算电路当然这个问题并不局限于一些传统的联想。你也了解特殊电路。我们已经知道要处理一些可疑的信号。我们需要一个好的计划。它类似于CPLD。我们需要添加一个触发器来生成一些注册输出。那是书中的特殊内容。好的我们可以用触发器。纳入APGM内部结构这里有很多。只是在CPL中被替换为已经这是同样的功能。作为一个小组已经PG的一种形式，我们正在进入一些选择表来强调模型公司。

And in the cprdspr is the end of array to generate some large functions after loss functional generally generatedthe output can be back into the black holeAnd all it can be directly expected Be used a couple,  how we can switchWe need to add one question here.  We use a multiplexer to switch to a combination mode and guess what This is how we can use fpj to generate the physical I think this kind of the first lecture. Okay, so let's have a break Next lecture, one back to the hdr program

在CPRDSPR中，是数组的末尾，用于生成一些大型函数后损失函数一般生成输出可以返回到黑洞中所有这些都是可以直接预期的用过几次我们如何切换我们需要在这里增加一个问题。我们使用多路复用器切换到组合模式，你猜怎么着？这就是我们如何使用FPJ生成物理我认为这种第一堂课好了，让我们休息一下下一节课，回到HDR项目

03月04日 12时03分


The Z is the two table, the output, the output of the output of the two tablefor the value of the Z will be topic into the answer. OkayAgain, for this example, a lot of youI'm making a mistake. Byebye.  What's the use of? That's totally You can imagine for each story yourself, it has addressed if you need toYeah, for each sort of stuff, that stress for the first oneit can be 0000 for one010They want it10101. ByebyeI'm not missing something. Byebye. Yes1997. Nasa. Nasa

Z是两个表的输出，两个表的输出的输出对于Z的值，将题目带入答案中。好的同样，在这个例子中，你们中的很多人我犯了个错误。拜拜的用处是什么？那完全是你可以自己想象每一个故事，它已经解决了如果你需要是的，对于每一种东西，第一个的压力它可以是0000为一010, 他们想要它拜拜我没有错过什么。拜拜是的1997, 美国太空总署美国太空总署

The 1001011.  That's a principle. Thanks We have to, first of all for the election has a dress 000 If we want to enter some value to this election, we need to prepare the drastic quarter to be 000We normallyalignment will be two. Go on and so forthThank you. Too, 000000 corresponds to the first electionIt doesn't mean we need to copy this zero into the feeling000 only means II adjust the total input only means now it's a time to write some number into the D latch ways to address 000Of course. Thank youSome fp GS may have different order. They can decide to share this style, will have the address to be 000The story of stuff, it's time for this story cell to write some important to write someday to thank.

1001, 011.这是个原则。谢谢我们首先要为选举准备一件衣服，000如果我们想在这次选举中获得一些价值，我们需要准备好激烈的季度。000, 我们通常对齐将是二继续等等。谢谢。也是，000000对应于第一次选举这并不意味着我们需要把这个零复制到感觉中。000只意味着我调整总输入只意味着现在是时候写一些数字了D锁存器用于寻址000当然谢谢某些FP G可能具有不同的顺序。他们可以决定分享这种风格，拥有地址为000。故事的东西，是时候让这个故事细胞写一些重要的东西来感谢某一天。

This is usedthis is use it for the address reporter and which data should be written into this or so. It's defined by the userIt's defined by using. So in this case The target is to copy the output Z into the store itself. RightIn this case, if the first one is 000, that we need to compare that data zero at the data in input,  this area will be written intoThe feeling is that it is clear. There are. Right The value insideThis is the value inside the image has no business with the goodThis is the only usage is to tell youNow it's a time for a debench to write some data in which direction depends on the dress And don't be confused about the inputOkay? Because this is not actually is happeningNow you can just use the value of 0 equals 1 to 2 control to be used as dataset control.

这是用过的这是用它作为地址记者。以及哪些数据应该写入这个或其他。它由用户定义。它是通过使用定义的。所以在这种情况下目标是复制输出Z到存储本身对的在这种情况下，如果第一个是000，我们需要比较那个数据零在输入数据时，该区域将被写入感觉是清晰的。有的对的里面的价值这是价值里面的形象，有没有生意的好。这是唯一的用法是告诉你现在是该下台的时候了。写入一些数据哪个方向取决于衣服。不要对输入感到困惑好的？因为这实际上并没有发生。现在，您可以只使用值0等于1到2的控件来用作数据集控件。

Okay You can use some other variables if you replace this one, but in this case,  it's multiplexer. It happens. You can use the exact same number, the best to control compiler jobs. So kind of skills Another about the terminology. Thank you.  For clvaclpI will say it contains a lot together with just 1/4I think it's fine. You say this is aclp. It's fine. If you want to say this is yourself so far. But a clb will contact with our employer. If you want to refer the later part to be a lot, it's also fun It doesn't matter They are for these tell these ok this,  how else do you have to produce nowadays for the digital electronic design? ByebyeAnd now we will progress to the program As long as well IE students as a digital national studentsyou have to learn some programming languages.

好的如果你替换这个变量，你可以使用一些其他的变量，但在这种情况下，它是多路复用器。它发生了。你可以使用完全相同的数字，最好用编译器控制。工作。所以这种技能另一个关于术语谢谢用于CLVACLP, 我会说它包含了很多，只有1/4。我觉得很好。你说这是ACLP。很好。如果你想说这是你自己到目前为止但是CLB将与我们的雇主联系。如果你想参考后面的部分，那也很有趣。这不重要他们是为了这些，告诉这些，好吧，你现在还能为数字电子设计生产什么？拜拜现在我们将取得进展。到程序只要把IE学生当成一个数字国家的学生。你必须学习一些编程语言。

I thatSo nowadays, when graduate, we want to find a job. If we want to do some job related to national engineering, national electric and also electronic engineer is a must To master some program like especially for electronic engineering, you need to learn very largelyvery long. It's a very important language. And if you want to beif we have ABC program. Question, byebye. At first termimportant for you to master from program language. And in this courseLastly, the year. Byebye Introduce apld program in the general processI think you should be very nervous that you have been used,  you have to start, you should have you done Do you know as far as teacher Singapore the same areasThis is some kind of is part of us. It is very familiar with the programming processAnd also the hard works from language. That's the language used to make out there for First, the plp program three componentsWhere is the computer?

我那个所以现在，当我们毕业的时候，我们想找一份工作。如果我们想做一些与国家工程相关的工作，国家电气和电子工程师是必须的。要掌握一些程序，特别是电子工程，你需要学习很多东西。很长。它是一种非常重要的语言。如果你想成为如果我们有ABC计划问题，拜拜在第一学期从编程语言开始掌握对你来说很重要。在这门课上最后是年份拜拜在通用过程中引入APLD程序我想你应该很紧张，因为你已经被利用了，你必须开始，你应该已经做了。你知道与新加坡老师相同的地区吗？这是某种是我们的一部分。它非常熟悉编程过程。还有语言方面的努力。这就是所使用的语言。在那里为.做准备第一，PLP计划三个组成部分电脑在哪里？

Of courseI don't need to introduce a computer now And a series of software This is a key component for the pictures of design. The city did not for computer aided design. Bitteraided designBut in computer aided designwhat can you do in the softwareThere is a designed schematic You can like see programming, you write a code and you can tell this code. This be fine. I think that. So you can do some simulationsand you will check some reforms, see if the reform needs of the market annex There will be some optimization algorithm inside, because normally we have a lot of variables to be equal to something PDF functionsBut it's not possibleIn many cases, in times every viable into this computer issue inside the area of much for income, some optimization algorithm to do some viable significationYou have learned that like panel map. You have a lot Lots of functions. You can specify the blood functionsIt saves resources

当然我现在不需要介绍电脑。和一系列软件这是设计图片的关键组成部分。这个城市不适合计算机辅助设计。激烈地辅助设计但是在计算机辅助设计中你能在软件里做什么？有一个设计原理图你可以看编程，你写一个代码，你可以告诉这个代码。这很好我认为。那么你可以做一些模拟。你会检查一些改革，看看改革是否需要市场。附件里面会有一些优化算法。因为通常我们有很多变数。等于PDF函数的东西但这不可能。在许多情况下，在每一个可行的时候进入这个电脑问题。在收益较大的领域内，一些优化算法做了一些可行的意义。你已经学过了，就像面板地图你有很多。很多功能。你可以指定血液功能它节省了资源

The same of marriage algorithm will be applied inside the TJ to the when you want to do some what functions where you can directly enter the original form into the issues and the xpg about in the situation. For me, the fpj uses another report to select asking optimization not necessarily want to introduce this course from I'd say something that we can also determine the internal structure of NPCFor example, if you want to calculate like X one and X two or X three and X four What you only to do is enter these functions into the software and software. Determine how the international violence will be considered, which law will be used and which our instruction use this totally defined by the if you want to be worried about it To download your code into your teacher board, we have two different ways for a programmerLike if you care this programmer that's kind of all updated, he was later basically is a socket, and you need to remove your lb check from the cloudy P CB four. And you need to insert that check into this subjectAnd you can read information from check The jpec interface. Do you think I you canIt's the full name is a jointa joint temple action group of joint tests don't actually doThat's for it's a four foot lines and four pins to each at PGA will have 14th dedicated to be used to this Jake information. It's a while it's a table. Can you use this table to connect to fpga pcd 4 or 24th and computersFor the study programming

同样的婚姻算法将在TJ内部应用于当你想做一些什么功能的时候，你可以直接进入原来的表单。进入问题和XPG大约在什么情况下。对我来说，FPJ使用另一份报告来选择询问优化，不一定要介绍这门课程。我想说的是，我们也可以确定NPC的内部结构。例如，如果您想像X 1和X 2或X 3和X 4那样计算你唯一要做的就是把这些功能输入到软件中。确定将如何考虑国际暴力，将使用哪种法律，以及我们的哪种指令使用这种法律完全由如果你想担心的话。要将代码下载到教师板中，我们为程序员提供了两种不同的方法就像如果你关心这个程序员这是一种更新，他后来基本上是一个插座，你需要从云中删除你的LB检查四个P CB。你需要把支票插入到这个主题中。你可以从支票上读取信息。JPEC接口你认为我你可以它的全称是一个关节。联合寺庙行动小组联合测试实际上并不起作用那是为了这是一条四英尺长的线，PGA的四个球瓶将有14个专门用于这个杰克的信息。这是一段时间，这是一张桌子。你能用这个表连接FPGA吗？PCD 4或24和计算机用于学习编程

This is. Byebye. Introduce because of what we can do inside and see the software, the design entry is for design. We can do that circuitBut you have to talk about offer speaking methods for answering your designThe first is not like a schematic entry Have you learned how do you use like thatYou use a similar that's very similar to sibling. There are some pre defined blocks or the models. And you can directly plot this modulus in copy that modulus inside into your circuit. And you do some connections because on wire desk for the schematic entryfor the city,  you can and to choose peopleJust like most like teacher accepts for two stable entry What we have done in a slightdo you have two stable and end of the two stable in the city softwareIt also worksInsert a third party, for instance, in system program

这是拜拜介绍因为我们可以在里面做什么，看到软件，设计入口。是为了设计。我们可以做那个电路。但是你必须谈论提供回答你的设计的演讲方法。第一个不像是一个示意性的条目。你学会怎么用那个了吗？你用一个类似的这与兄弟姐妹非常相似。有一些预定义的块或者模特。你可以直接画出这个模数，把它复制到你的电路中。你做了一些连接，因为在原理图入口的接线台上。对于城市，你可以以及选择人。就像大多数喜欢老师接受两个稳定的条目一样。我们所做的你有两个稳和底两个稳的城市软件吗？它也起作用例如，在系统程序中插入第三方

For instance, programming is just you can use some excelsThank you to make the function work properly That's in the countryAnd then CNC is in debug that you emphasize it and the software will talk for you and optimization that while the panel map or the patient that becomesthe variables can be simplified in this stage. So it takes the resource and its accelerates the implication for the PGAAnd next stipulationSo after you compound this code, you will see sounds waveformsespecially for you.  If you wanted to find hunger, you will see a waveform like generate the signals from 000211112, four four hundred You can check if the sequence order matches of the Mark OK and a physical design that fpgs wereThat means a picture of a design,  the term in which our pains, which part of the circuit, which part of the Cr BS will be used to put in.

例如，编程只是你可以使用一些Excel。感谢您使该功能正常工作那是在乡下。然后进行CNC调试。你强调它和软件会为你说话和优化。当面板映射或病人成为在此阶段可以简化变量。所以它占用了资源，加速了对PGA的影响。和下一个规定所以在你合成这个代码之后，你会看到声音波形。尤其是对你来说。如果你想找到饥饿，你会看到一个类似于从0002产生信号的波形。11112四千四百您可以检查序列顺序是否与标记匹配好的和物理设计，其中FPG这意味着一个设计的图片，我们的痛苦，电路的哪一部分，Cr BS的哪一部分将被用来投入。

And each plans your optionsThe last program, as we can download, you can translate, the pl DS will help you to translate that hdl language or other domestic entry into the machine called international that the machine can understandThat's also the teachers care this work These are for examplesfor the daily software In this course, we are using our products too That are developed by the first come for us company that the company.  Do you know extra cheer? You actually have a joint lab with someThe joint lab is established in 2009. And at that time the vice presidents of the opera company visit the situation and open time last year. Thank youI think the lab is on the floor by fighting, I think, yeah

而且每个计划你的选择最后一个程序，我们可以下载，你可以翻译，PL DS会帮你翻译。即HDL语言或其他国内进入的机器称为国际，即机器可以理解。这也是老师们关心的工作。这些是示例对于日常软件在本课程中，我们也使用了我们的产品那是由第一家为我们开发的公司那家公司你知道吗额外的欢呼？你实际上和一些人有一个联合实验室联合实验室成立在2009年和那个时候歌剧团副社长去年参观情况及开放时间谢谢我想实验室在地板上。通过战斗，我想，是的。

Sorry, I could just generally it's originally owned by European company, but later it was transferred to the us company. Do you know now that moment for the city is also quite hard for China.  So uus government are really made Chinese companies to use this as well For the IC, this is also USA company So most of the resources mastered by us company, Mark I probably many companies have been provision to use the softwaremaking our own theory software We have two different ways to read some data from the first is that using a programmer and you won't be unfamiliar with this thing should be partly I think you are2 years old, so maybe ten, 15 years oldThere's a very famous the machine. It could then become. Do you know that? And onIt's a very famous Chinese name where is enters the Chinese market I want to see these things that S

抱歉，我只能泛泛而谈。它原本属于一家欧洲公司，但后来转让给美国公司你知道吗现在，这座城市的时刻对中国来说也是相当艰难的。所以美国政府真的让中国公司也使用这个。对于IC，这也是一家美国公司所以大部分的资源都是由美国公司马克掌握的我可能有很多公司都在使用这个软件。制作我们自己的理论软件我们有两种不同的方法来读取一些数据，第一种是使用程序员。和你不会的不熟悉这个东西应该是部分的。我觉得你是。2岁，所以也许10岁15岁有一个非常有名的机器。然后它可能会变成你知道吗？然后继续这是一个非常著名的中国品牌，它进入了中国市场。我想看看这些东西。

Okay. So basically, we have a machine and a seat socketIf you have played that machine, you have some their card, right? It's also nice to check. And you concerned that I check into this office and you can read the data very similar productionAre you the zero cable next to the action of the things and TV? And in this case, it's a computer I remember when I first decided to buy such a machine, I think it's a very smart marketing strategy, rightThe company knows that the Chinese parentsthey care more about the study, right You say this is a Xiao bao long If it's a generalThank you. Many Chinese parents were not fake for China, but at that time to find a total parents who want to learn some stuff II want to study, right? I want to do something. I need some knowledge

好的。所以基本上我们有一台机器和一个座位插座如果你玩过那台机器，你就有一些他们的牌，对吗？检查一下也很好。你担心我去这间办公室你能读到数据？非常相似的生产你是零线旁边的东西和电视的动作吗？在这种情况下，它是一台计算机我记得我第一次决定购买这样一台机器，我认为这是一个非常聪明的营销策略，对吗？公司知道中国父母他们更关心学习，对吧？你说这是一个小宝龙。如果是将军的话谢谢。很多中国家长对中国来说不是假的，找到一个总想学一些东西的父母，我想学习，对吗？我想做点什么。我需要一些知识。

Thank you. So I called on this is studying machine, is by, so I learned a lot of knowledge. So I learned how to play Super Mario on that machine Yes, and this account spld is not used for this program is only used for extra yearRight out of it.  Nowadays we have people,  we have switched and it's not a business with such AA program switch Years ago, we have PSP, right?  Nps, young boy ST, right? I thought every this and things are. Okay The second is that this is programming This means insistent program is the average. You have four yj platforms There are four kings that headed on the 30s for the drink of coffee. Okay It's another use for securities and machines I just in the lab,  you such a you want to use the data How can the programmingWhat we need to do is actually mainly rely on the design. And yeah, because we have two different ways, the schematic true

谢谢。所以我就叫上了这台正在学习的机器，是靠，所以我学到了很多知识。所以我学会了如何在那台机器上玩超级马里奥。是的，此帐户SPLD不用于此计划，仅用于额外的一年就在外面。现在我们有人，我们已经转换了，这不是一个有这样的AA程序转换的业务。几年前，我们有PSP，对吗？NPS，小男孩街，对吗？我以为每件事都是好的第二个是这是编程。这意味着坚持的程序是平均的。你有四个YJ平台。有四个国王在30岁的时候去喝咖啡。好的这是证券和机器的另一种用途。我只是在实验室，你这样的你想用数据。编程怎么能我们要做的其实主要是靠设计。和是的，因为我们有两种不同的方法，原理图真的

That's a very similar way to this, not that similarAnd choose tableBut these twothey are very limited to small number of variablesDo you know what we have done in fortune stable? If we have two rivals, we at least have caught four holdings of the Tuesday. It has three bibles. There are eight coins. Sorry, it rose of the Tuesday. What is we have 100 rivalsIt's very impossible for human being to answer the entire procedure for this programIt's a stimulus condition for the massive capture. You cannot say our desirea a robot or design a rocket using laptop siblingRight? It's impossible That's how the hardware description like becomes. You can use HD RSActually, you HD lsyou can use maybe 2 or 3 pages of April paper to design the CPU. Very convenientThe HD of the notes for hardware description language is a computer language that we use dedicated to describing hardware. Here. These I know you have learned some other program languages like Python or maybe not Python or C programs like that.

这是一个非常相似的方式，不是那么相似。然后选择表但这两个它们非常局限于少量变量。你知道我们在福琼马厩里做了什么吗？如果我们有两个对手，我们至少抓住了周二的四个持股。它有三本圣经。有八个硬币。对不起，是罗斯星期二的。我们有100个对手是什么？人类不可能回答这个程序的整个过程。这是大规模捕获的刺激条件。你不能说我们的愿望一个机器人或使用笔记本电脑兄弟设计火箭对的？这不可能这就是硬件描述的样子。您可以使用HD RS实际上，你是HD LS您可以使用大约2或3页的四月论文来设计CPU。非常方便Notes for Hardware Description Language的HD是我们专门用来描述硬件的计算机语言。这里。这些我知道你学过一些其他的编程语言，比如Python，或者可能不是Python，或者像这样的C程序。

Java and C plus and actually also for pricing, the hpr is different from these program languages. Because those are conventional programming languagesWe call that a sequential programBut for hdr, it's coherent programFrom the Top of this later, the general idea is the order of the horrible language description. The order of the quote doesn't matterBut that's not the case. What's the program of Python? Is the order of method This deal is designed for a couple and technologyThat means you have a conveniently transferred your HBO code from one kob. Now as far as and also other companies, their program library can be transferred each other if they all have internal package that can help to transfer for hdr to very low overall to be a steer a PP for a long position more popular nowadays. A couple of ages This is an overview of the common you commonly use hds The first, the very longthe simple, very verified logic this is the most popular

爪哇和C+实际上，在定价方面，HPR与这些程序语言不同。因为这些是传统的编程语言。我们称之为顺序程序。但对于HDR来说，它是一个连贯的程序从这后面的顶部，总体思路是顺序的恐怖语言描述。引用的顺序并不重要但事实并非如此。Python的程序是什么？是方法的顺序这笔交易是为一对夫妇和技术设计的。这意味着您可以方便地从一个KOB转移您的HBO代码。现在远至还有其他公司，他们的程序库可以相互转移，如果他们都有内部包，可以帮助将HDR转移到非常低的整体，成为一个指导现在更流行的多头头寸的PP。几年前这是您通常使用的HDS的概述第一个，很长简单的，非常有效的逻辑这是最受欢迎的。

It should be elaborate nowadaysOkay, it's also IE standard This spoken language is divided by Stanford UniversityUniversity in 1995 This program language is very low, is C based on C program You have to study, you have a courseee 339, another course Lectured by doctor ming Xu. Bye bye, bye bye bye. Byebye English. In the first part of thata module, doctor mean something to Guide you how to use a very large program. It's very useful for people to drop that. I can't feel of then. What's up to you Second vsvr, the very high speed integrated services deal. So then the vhdr is divided by us is developed by the Department of Defense of America It's developed in the early 1980s, I think 1980sIt's meant for the military use at the first it becomes IE standard. But the very wellI feel is much more popular than PhD in our eu because first of all,  it's is written C and the face of C program parallel are similar to C program, but for which they arewe have another programming language partVery sad. I think you shouldn't have put upThere are two things happen We never use this So that's why the HBO can be used for minister use ok Third comes to ahd or the author HBO that the program like to use in this course, right Hdl is not that popularProbably is a very long periodThe C tax,  it's very easy to follow.

现在应该是精心制作的。好的，这也是IE标准这个口语是斯坦福大学划分的。1995年上大学这个程序语言很低级，是基于C的C程序。你必须学习，你有一门课程EE 339，另一门课程徐明博士主讲拜拜，拜拜拜拜英语。在第一部分中一个模块，博士的意思是指导你如何使用一个非常大的程序。对人们来说，放弃它是非常有用的。我感觉不到那时的你怎么了？第二个VSVR，超高速集成服务交易那么接下来VHDR被我们分割了。是由美国国防部开发的它是在20世纪80年代初发展起来的，我想是80年代。这是军用的。一开始它成为IE标准但是很好我觉得在我们欧盟比博士更受欢迎，因为首先它是是用C写的，而且C程序的表面是并行的，与C程序相似，但它们是针对哪一方面的我们还有另一个编程语言部分。非常伤心。我认为你不应该忍受有两件事发生了。我们从不用这个。所以这就是为什么HBO可以用于部长使用的原因。第三个是AHD或者HBO的作者，这个节目喜欢在这个课程中使用，对吧？高密度脂蛋白并不那么受欢迎。可能是一个很长的时期。C税，很容易理解。

So it's a very good point for youBe used at a start. to get touched in. This is your program. Thank you so muchAnd the bell and the coupon and this program languages are used for sprd Almost no one used that nowadays In this case, in the possible interpretation, okBut this is the general structure of how your ahl,  how and the structureThe firstDo you have a documentationDocumentation means you're making name. You are coldAverage in your code have the nameWhere is my name? IsAnd the second, the aisle definitionsIn this case, we have two important parts to be differentFirst, the monk. Second timethe modifies thatBut if the four is the input for output proposeThe both meetings are ok and not pay for the bidirectional If the law can declare this Now there is a typeThe time means a number of things I did for the watch, tooA wider working for one day, but you can declare that this Bible welcome to have a multiple case. They will see this in next week. Most of it next after the ill definition, comes to the function of description. That's where you put your, if loop called the table structure or key structure or other functional All the questions, how it is kind of functions that all this code will be placed into a section called optional description It starts with the beginning and end with the end.  That's let's see an example that's your first call for H.  I know this programming. You always start with hard work, rightThe hr, you start with a and B within and gave the first documentation you need to name the code in place to declare this is a documentation is a key wordsubdivide

所以这对你来说是一个很好的观点。一开始就被使用。接触到。这是你的程序。非常感谢贝尔和优惠券以及该程序语言用于SPRD。现在几乎没人用那个了。在这种情况下，在可能的解释中不错但这是你的AHL的一般结构怎样还有结构第一个你有文件吗？文档意味着你在创造名声。你很冷平均在你的代码中有这个名字。我的名字在哪里？是第二，过道的定义。在这种情况下，我们有两个重要的部分是不同的第一，和尚第二次修改了这一点但如果四是输入用于输出计划两个会议都可以。而不是为双向支付如果法律可以宣布这一点现在有一种类型时间意味着很多事情。我也为手表做了。一个更广泛的工作一天，但你可以宣布，这本圣经欢迎有多个案件。他们将在下周看到这个。大部分吧在不好的定义之后，接下来是描述的功能。这就是你放置if循环（称为表结构或键结构或其他函数）的地方。所有的问题，所有这些代码的功能是如何放置的添加到名为“可选说明”的部分中以始为始，以终为终。那是让我们看一个例子，这是你第一次调用H。我知道这个编程。你总是从努力工作开始，对吗？HR，你从A和B开始内在和给予第一个您需要命名代码的文档到位声明这是一个文档是一个关键词。细分

This means it's now what follows will be the name of the hl code. In this case, we have made the code for negative You should know that the sub design, in this case, having in the uppercase is characterizedBut this is not the requirement for ahdrHl is case insensitive It doesn't matter. We use lower face or application for this subject, and it doesn't matter for this nameBut remember, by conventionall these reverse work or the key word will be used in uppercase. Give me the meaning of of the case, right? Thank youAnd all the Bible names defined by the users will be the lower case despite conventionBut in the examif you make a mistake to make the key word could be lowercase or divide them to be upper case, it doesn't matterOkay? And also when you program, when you enter these codes into the real machines in 1/4 to downloadif I can mention there is a good habit for programmer

这意味着现在接下来的将是HL代码的名称。在这种情况下，我们已经制定了代码为阴性您应该知道，在本例中，大写的子设计是特征化的但这不是AHDR的要求HL是不区分大小写这不重要。对于这个主题，我们使用较低的面或应用程序，这与这个名称无关。但请记住，按照惯例所有这些反向工作或者关键词。将以大写形式使用给我…的意思案子的，对吧？谢谢以及用户定义的所有圣经名称。将是小写尽管有惯例但在考试中如果你犯了一个错误，关键字可能是小写的，或者把它们分成大写的，这并不重要。好的？而且当你编程的时候，当你把这些代码输入到真实的机器中1/4来下载。如果我能提到程序员有一个好习惯

And nextfor the application. And that is the oil definitions The oil definitions comes with a persistence Inside this process, you define the definitions,  you define all things. In this case, it's engaged. We have two inputA for my feetRemember the former okthe two different improbable can be separated using comma With that as an inputthe a and B are cool and why the white name, white, the outputIf this is our definitionsand next come to the functional descriptionThe function description starts with begin and end with end They speaking and they can be lowercaseBut by convention, its uppercase that's very easy to England and engage Y equals to a and B has created. And in HD Remember, after each statement, you will need a semicolonIt's very important And also that don't get this problem. Otherwise, your program notHe compels successfullyAnd also, after the end, there is a sunny columnThey're not and not at the later part of the beginning but I cannot and keywords that a certain quality.

还有下一个对于应用程序。这就是石油的定义。油的定义附带的一种坚持在这个过程中，你定义了定义，你定义了所有的东西。在这种情况下，它被占用了。我们有两个输入A, 为了我的脚记住前者，好吗？这两个不同的可能性可以用逗号分开以此为输入A和B很酷，为什么白色的名字，白色的，输出如果这是我们的定义接下来是功能描述。函数说明以BEGIN开头，以END结尾他们说话，他们可以小写。但按照惯例，它是大写的这对英国来说很容易，使Y等于A和B。已经创建了。还有高清的请记住，在每条语句后面都需要一个分号这很重要也不会有这个问题。否则，您的程序不他成功地强迫而且，在结束之后，还有一个阳光专栏。他们不是，也不是在开始的后面部分，但我不能和关键词有一定的质量。

OkayAbc are let's go for ahdm The so pizza doesn't means that block is an gate and definitions of inputs or posts are closed in the processes. Okay If we want to use a pain to be both at the aisle pains to be both input and output, we can use five direction using the keyboard and its description of functions descriptionthe written between 15 and keywordsIn this case, we are designing and gate so we use itAnd symbols.  Also we have explanation for not and the harsh for all. And the goal aside, for example you need to memorize all these operations It's very common in other programming languages that we will have some intermediate signal All a local Bible In HBO, these intermediate signals are called buried notes.  So these are notes that she knows neither to be used an input or output of lawThey are only available within this block You must say it's an intro the intersection between the infinitesimal and popularThis becomes very useful. When there's a very large, we have a lot of variables We can first calculate AMD and store the value into AA local wife, a very note called and can use and to start value and can use. And so calculate the letter to be used for the later calculation, in this case, is C or F Very useful for largest That is the signal for extra paragraph First, this percentage, Sam, in a E ahdr, we use this a pair of catch up% symbols to denote these commentsAnd comments in multiple lines will be enclosed by this same symbols. ByebyeAnd for a single and commentwe use to slash the two dashes

好的ABC是让我们去AHDMSo Pizza并不意味着块是一个门和输入或帖子的定义。在进程中关闭。好的如果我们想用一个通道的痛苦既是输入又是输出，我们可以用五个方向。使用键盘及其功能描述说明写在15和关键字之间在这种情况下，我们正在设计和门，所以我们使用它和符号。我们也有说明为了不对所有人都很苛刻。例如，除了目标之外，你需要记住所有这些操作。在其他编程语言中，我们通常会有一些中间信号。当地的圣经在HBO中，这些中间信号被称为隐藏的音符所以这些是笔记。她知道既不是法律的输入也不是法律的输出它们仅在此区块内可用你必须说这是一个介绍。无穷小与大众的交集这变得非常有用。当有一个非常大的，我们有很多变量。我们可以先计算AMD的值，并将其存储到AA本地的妻子，非常注意调用和使用，并开始使用和可以使用的值。所以计算在这种情况下，用于后面计算的字母是C或F对于最大的非常有用这就是信号。用于额外的段落首先，这个百分比，萨姆，在E AHDR，我们用这个一双迎头赶上%符号表示这些评论多行中的注释将用相同的符号括起来。拜拜对于单个和注释我们用两个破折号这两个因素意味着只有一个评论。

The two factors means there's a single comment Against sub design of temptation and the fire and common name, our definitions, ABC input, Y output Now to decline, we have to to define some very note. We have another section for the variety of but in this life is actually we can define and the viable end to be known as the intermediate schoolLater, in next few weeks, you will see we are defined a lot of other let's say,  for instances we can become different instances in inside this Bible sections and between and the functional descriptionthe first N equals to a and B generally some varied output. And we can calculate AAA and bocu Xin mocas I mentioned enough We have slides, okayBut every skills are the problem means the order don't matter. So in this case, you can switch decision of the home

逆子设计的诱惑和火和共同的名字，我们的定义，ABC输入，Y输出现在要拒绝，我们必须来定义一些非常重要的事情。我们还有另一个部门。为了各种各样的但这一生其实是我们可以定义的。可行的结局是被称为中级学校。稍后，在接下来的几周里，你会看到我们被定义了很多其他的让我们说例如我们可以在这个圣经章节中成为不同的例子。和功能描述之间第一个n等于a和B通常有一些不同的输出。我们可以计算AAA和Bocu Xin MOC正如我所提到的我们有幻灯片，好吗？但每个技能都是。这个问题意味着顺序并不重要。所以在这种情况下，你可以切换家庭的决定对于编程语言来说，这只是其中的一种情况。

It's been but this one of these cases for the program languages this is called local level or the intermediate signalPurpose,  the comments is imposed by power% characters and optional viable section. The viable section will be used to declare these fibers and prepared notes, primitives, the primitives primitive in some are pre defined functions in edge fields you can directly call these functions But to directly use these functions, for example,  in HBO, we have a tri state buffer. We have left, you have deeper flow, objective blood flow What do you need to do is to do all these call these libraries in the Bible section. You please note to be a directly at web or dff and use some viable to name this Bible and then you are created equal to clockCan you answer this in the next? Thank you so much Just remember all these carbon nodes or these primitives will be declared inside the variables I think this is the last 5 years, and so this is the overall comparison to Excel and other program managers. We have probably most of these contracts, I thinkFor HBO, these codes are evaluated constantly and potentially meansall right, now let's get makes no difference

这称为本地电平或中间信号目的，注释是由幂%字符和可选的可行部分施加的。可行部分将用于声明这些纤维和准备好的注释、原语原始人有些是原始的。预定义功能在边缘场中您可以直接调用这些函数但要直接使用这些功能，例如在HBO中，我们有一个三态缓冲器。我们离开了，你有更深的流动，客观的血液流动你需要做的就是把这些都做好。把这些图书馆称为圣经区。请注意成为一个直接在网络或DFF，并使用一些可行的名字来命名这本圣经，然后你被创造为时钟。你能在下一节回答这个问题吗？非常感谢请记住，所有这些Carbon节点或这些原语都将在变量中声明。我想这是过去的5年，所以这是与Excel和其他程序管理器的总体比较。我想我们可能有大部分这样的合同。对于HBO，这些代码被不断地评估，并且可能意味着好了，现在让我们没有区别相比之下

The in contrastAC programming on the computer programming, the instructions for is one thing That's what basically you are you a so please waitSome question for that is what our first class place. NasaBye bye. So going to be nervous about the first, I think it's very easy. OkayNasa. All you need to answer the page is limited to the lecture flight from 123. You will have one or two questions I think in the first hour, we will have lesson five in 7 hours from how we need to probably you have 40 or 45 minutes to answer.  I will have to go the touching sheet while and you can I'll answer you can do that answers on your paper on time and you upload your answers to. All right In this class, we do have like how much space and tables, right? For example, answer, you want to go outside, answer these questionsIt's not a book.

计算机上的交流编程编程，指令是一件事这就是你的基本情况所以请稍候一些问题是，我们的头等舱是什么地方美国太空总署拜拜。所以对第一场比赛感到紧张，我认为这很容易。好的美国太空总署。所有你需要回答的页面仅限于从123起飞的讲座。你将有一个或两个问题。我想在第一个小时，我们将在7个小时后上第五课。从如何我们需要你大概有40到45分钟来回答。我得走了。触摸床单的时候，你可以我会回答的，你可以按时把答案写在纸上，然后把你的答案上传到。好吧在这门课上，我们有多少空间和桌子，对吗？例如，回答，你想去外面，回答这些问题这不是一本书。不

No In the book, I can't match with one or outside hereI know this hour is todayThank you, boss. Nasa

在书中，我不能与一个或在这里以外的匹配我知道今天是这个时候。谢谢你，老板美国太空总署
