前面几分钟在问大家想要什么时候office hour，后面会发邮件

03月05日 09时10分


Most of it it seems no, as they not know the态度 If I arrange something that I'm not available,  II have office hours Monday, Thursday, I believe And if

Which is not the way you can also make use of the office hour. OkayBut I will let you know when the ta session will be arranged by Email Email being like aRight Last time we tried to introduce what communication system is doing roughly what it looks like motivates the needs of doing modulation.  We are going to make or concrete firework modulation means.  Today we are going to introduce two, perhaps the most the simplest two modulation schemeas you just had to change the amplitude of a prepared signalwe will make those concepts clear But then we've also had a revision problem in a system that we are seriously.

这不是你也可以充分利用办公时间好的但我会让你知道TA会议将通过电子邮件安排电子邮件存在就像一个对的上次我们试着介绍什么？通讯系统正在大致做它看起来的样子。激发进行调制的需求。我们要让或混凝土烟花调制手段今天我们将介绍两个，也许是最多的最简单的两种调制方案因为你只需要改变准备好的信号的幅度。我们将阐明这些概念。但是我们也有一个系统中的修订问题，我们是认真的。

Therefore the fact that when you multiply something with the cosine wave that would move the spectrum from the base. And to ask themgives you a motivation scheme that carries that the most your information bearing signal to a higher frequency. But that's already modulation And also for the for the detection purpose We mentioned that for transmission for the suitability of transmitting message bearing signal over, for example, such a small size and planner, we need to move the signal to higher frequency. But at the receiver side,  we need to move it backWe need to convert the high frequency signal back to what it used to be we have to do detection and within the detection of, well, within the modulation circuit,  we also have to do filtering.

因此当你乘以余弦波时这将把光谱从底部移走。去问他们。给你一个激励计划。它将你的大部分信息承载信号传输到更高的频率。但那已经是调制了。也是为了用于检测目的我们提到了传输对于传输的适用性消息承载信号例如，在如此小的尺寸和规划器上，我们需要将信号移动到更高的频率。但在接收器一侧，我们需要将其向后移动我们需要将高频信号转换回以前的样子。我们必须做检测和在检测范围内，以及在调制范围内电路，我们还要做滤波。

And that's also where the concept of the new systemit's useful All later on, you will also see that we will introduce more fantasy ways of doing modulation schemes where we compare the banquet requirements. What do you thinkIt is great Whichagain,  we will use the not a terms in only transforms please try trying to make yourself familiar with all these things Because we teach we've revealed thisWould they transform hair that if you have a rectangle house. And looks like this that has a duration of tau is fully transform, is a sync functionAnd for for our purpose But to this,  when we introduce the bandwidth Or for convenience,  we will just refer to the width of this main look as the bandwidth We mentioned that the negative frequency of the fourier transformers not really made physical sense.

和这也是新系统的概念所在。它很有用稍后，您还将看到我们将介绍更多内容做调制方案的幻想方式我们比较宴会的地方要求。你怎么看它是伟大的哪个同样，我们将使用非A仅限中的术语变换请试着让自己熟悉一下。用所有这些东西。因为我们教导我们已经揭示了这一点。如果你有一个，他们会改变头发吗？长方形房子。和看起来像这个，持续时间为τ是完全转换，是同步功能也是为了为了我们的目的但对此，当我们引入带宽或者为了方便起见，我们将只把这个主外观的宽度称为带宽我们提到过负频率傅立叶变换器不是真正制造的身体感觉。

It is there to give you information about the face spectrum In that case, if you just look at the main load and the bandwidth of this rectangular pulse of durationhow would have abandoned of one over townQuite convenientlyif the derivation is higher than the bandwidththen the bandwidth is one over tau If we want toif you want to transmit this house faster in that use less amount of time to transmit this house. So you reduce how the cows reduced and went over, how is increased If you translate things faster, you need higher benefitIf we just leave things slower, you need less benefit That's that comes from the time scaling property for the collision form One thing that might be used to imagine is that we when we talk about bandwidth for convenience,  we ignore this sidewalk, which has small amplitude Yeah,  one of the rationality is that from the past several theoremthe time domain,  you can calculate the energy of the time domain by the epsilon squared integrating over all time. That gives you the energy of this thing that is equal to the magnitude squared of the frequency spectrum as well If you just integrate the main loop, then it already contains most of the energy In that sense we can have 45 year bond How the bandwidth how much bandwidth is sort of rectangular house would change It just have a rough measurement,  not precise. Good enough for our purpose We have the duality in what they transform If you have a time if you have this same function in the time domainthen you would have this rectangular house in the frequency of many

它的存在是为了给你关于面部光谱的信息。在这种情况下，如果你只看主负载和这个矩形脉冲的带宽持续时间怎么会放弃了一个城镇。相当方便如果导数高于带宽则带宽是τ上的1如果我们想如果你想更快地传送这个房子以使用更少时间量传送这栋房子。所以你减少怎样牛减小了，跑过去了，怎么样？是增加的如果你翻译得更快，你需要更高的收益。如果我们只是让事情慢下来，你需要的好处就少了。就是这样来自碰撞形式的时间缩放属性可以用来想象的一件事是我们当我们谈论带宽时为了方便起见，我们忽略这个人行道，振幅较小对，合理性之一就是从过去的几个定理时域，你可以计算时域的能量。由在所有时间上的ε平方积分。这给了你这东西的能量。它等于频谱的幅度平方如果你只对主回路进行积分，那么它已经包含了大部分的能量。在这个意义上我们可以有45年期债券显示带宽带宽是多少？长方形的房子会改变。它只是有一个粗糙的测量，不精确对我们的目的来说足够好了我们在他们转变的东西中有二元性。如果你有时间如果你在时域中有同样的功能，那么你就会在许多频率中拥有这个长方形的房子。

If you have and linear system that has a impulse response that looks like a sink house in the frequencies domain in to rubber is its frequency response looks like this, which is basically an ideal low pass filter What's an ideal low pass filter would do is illustrated here Assume that you have an input signal X that equals signals further into a linear system denoted by H, then the output in the frequency domain would be the frequency spectrum of text multiply by the frequency response. A page The multiplication here isn't very hard to do because beyond-12 twin tower two The frequency response of the filter is zeroEverything beyond minus how old two and power to will be this, we will disappear. So it looks like this.  It is hard and that hard to disappear Everything we think minus tau over two and tau two region will remain unchangedThat's an ideal low pass paper

如果你有和线性系统那有一个看起来像水槽的脉冲响应房子在频域中橡胶的频率响应是这样的，基本上是理想低通滤波器理想的低通滤波器的作用如图所示。假设你有一个输入信号X这相当于信号进一步进入线性系统。用H表示，则输出在频域中，将文本的频谱乘以频率响应。一页这里的乘法不是很难做到，因为超越-12双塔2滤波器的频率响应为零负号以外的一切多大的两岁和的权力将会是这个，我们会消失。所以它看起来像这样。这很难，而且很难。消失我们所想的一切2上的负τ和τ2区域将保持不变那是一张理想的低通纸。

The effect of ideal of how to do this illustrated here So that there were some exercises related to the concepts of linear systems and how you manipulate time to make signals.  I I'm not going into, I'm not back into the details.  If you're given a signal xt that looks like that thing on the write commentupright corner office P PT, then the question to ask you,  what is Xcapital T minus T111 way to do it is that you just try out between values of small T You can find a new the new function Phi onesmoking equal to X, capital T minus small TAnd then try out a few values of small T and C What is new function? Five and T would take From there you can figure out how five and he looks like, or that X pepper, T minus T of 12 The rest who look the same I had,  but the observations that if you have a who multiply by small T than the fingers The time that we signal got compressed you could have a negative sign there that you are going backwards in time This is just another quick revision on the concept of impulse response If you have an input signal that I just in houses and the the Delta functions. But possibly with different delays, the first oneDelta T minus one is divided by one time unit Then the outputwhich will be in the form of the impulse response ht. But it's also going to be delayed by one time unit If you have a linear combination of three different in classes The output will be the the same linear combinations is different delays with this, the corresponding delays

这里说明了如何做到这一点的理想效果。所以有一些相关的练习线性系统的概念以及你如何操纵时间发出信号。我不会深入，我不会回到细节。如果你被给予一个看起来像那个东西的信号XT在写注释直立角办公室那么，P pt问你的问题是，X是什么？大写T减去T111这样做的方法是，你只需在小t的值之间进行尝试。你可以找到一个新的新函数φ1抽烟等于X，大写T减去小写T然后尝试小T和C的几个值什么是新功能？五和T将采取从那里你可以弄清楚怎么五和他长得像，还是那个X？胡椒，T减去12的T剩下的谁看起来一样？我有，但观察到如果你有谁乘以比手指小的T我们发信号的时间被压缩了。你可能会有一个负号。你在时光倒流。这只是另一个上的快速修订脉冲响应的概念如果你有一个输入信号，我只是在房子里。还有德尔塔函数但是可能有不同的延迟，第一个ΔT减1除以一个时间单位然后是输出其将是脉冲响应HT的形式。但它也会被延迟一个时间单位。如果你有一个线性组合三个不同的班级输出将为一样的线性组合是不同的延迟与此，相应的延迟

You have if if your a house response is delayed by a 3 time units, then they just delayed the output 535 minutes. That's all You can delay the inputI keep buy some amount of time and the output, which which will resemble the impulse response, will also be delayed by that amount of time If you delay the impulse response by a certain amount of time, then the agenda output delayed by this the same amount of time The delay can be applied to ego and output with the same effect This question Was basically asking you what would be the the group,  the footage transform of the delayed version of the Delta function?  We mentioned that Delta T,  if you have a linear system the evils response is Delta from then that that linear system, that's the channel between the transmitter and the receiver of the idea

你有如果如果你的房子回应延迟了一个3个时间单位，然后他们只是推迟了53号的输出。5分钟。说完了你可以延迟输入。我一直在购买一些时间和输出，其将类似于脉冲响应，也将被延迟该时间量如果你延迟脉冲响应在一定的时间内，然后议程输出延迟了相同的时间。延迟可以应用于EGO和输出，具有相同的效果这个问题基本上是在问你。会是什么？组，Delta函数的延迟版本的镜头变换。我们提到过，如果你有一个线性系统邪恶的反应是德尔塔。从那时起这个线性系统，就是这个想法的发射器和接收器之间的通道。

Because whatever you have at the input to get the same thing at the output Even if there is a delay of have AP is it's okay, it's just like you delay the input by and faculty,  the time units,  the the shape of the outer they say exactly the same as the input signal So it's an ideal channel impulse response in that sense In. But if you do the improvements and fully transform of that delayed as a functionthen you get like thatwhich tells you that the amplitude response, the amplitude of this. All rightAcross the frequency is kept at at one, but the base at different frequencies are delay according to high speed Which is the facewhich is the additional phase of need to keep difference frequency components That the relative position of the different frequency. The world is not true The total effect is that the whole signal is delayed. It second They did this questionHow to revise the same function if you have that rectangular pulse into the collection for, it gives you the same function, basically, sine X divided by X with some other constant that is related to the time period

因为无论你有什么在输入端得到同样的结果。即使有AP的延迟也没关系，就像你延迟输入一样。和教员时间单位那外部的形状它们表示与输入信号完全相同所以从这个意义上说，它是一个理想的信道脉冲响应。在。但是如果你把延迟作为一个功能进行改进和完全转换，那你就得到就像那样它告诉你振幅响应，这个好吧整个频率保持在在1，但在不同频率的基础是延迟根据高速哪个是脸？这是需要保持的额外阶段不同频率分量那个亲戚不同频率的位置世界不是真的。总的效果是整个信号被延迟。它第二他们做了这个问题。如果你有相同的功能，如何修改矩形脉冲进入集合，它给你相同的函数，基本上，正弦X除以X。与其他一些常数相关的时间段

You may have seen from other sources or textbooks that they define same function differently Some of them even use this test a sampling function Which is defined by sine X divided by X They mean more or less the same. But when you have to write these things, try to try to be clear on which definition you are following Because the city is too that the nations do have the difference of time in the armyYeah,  but just be clear on which one you are listening This one was trying to review what is the footage of cosineand what is the fully transformed sign The result is that you have the foolish transformer code says to it's a two Delta functions on the frequency. One is on FC, and the other is on minus FC.

你可能已经看到了从其他来源或教科书中，他们对相同功能的定义不同他们中的一些人甚至使用这个测试采样功能其由正弦X除以X来定义它们的意思大致相同。但是当你必须写这些东西的时候，试着试着弄清楚你所遵循的定义。因为城市太国家确实有。时间的差异在军队里是啊，但要清楚你在听哪一个。这个我想回顾一下余弦的镜头是什么什么是完全变形的符号？结果是你有愚蠢的变压器代码说它是关于频率的两个δ函数。一个在FC上，另一个在负FC上

So there will be illustration later. But if you multiply times only signal is cosineAnd the frequency domainyou can allude these two Delta functions with the frequency spectrum of that signal When you keep convolution in the previous of may you have you change the frequency fan of that signalI have FC We will see that is that they are the sector here Okay, so it's asking you But the question is sayingshow that the cosine wave oscillating frequency of Pepsi multiplied by the same function keeps you,  I feel bent possible We know that the same function, the second term is the impulse response of an ideal low pass filter We recruit the show that before Which would havein,  sorry, frequency response that looks like thiswhich is an ideal low pass filter, are in the if you multiply things in time domain in the frequency domain

那么稍后会有说明。但如果你乘以仅时间信号为余弦和频域你可以提到这两个δ函数。该信号的频谱当你在五月前保持卷积时你有你改变频率那个的粉丝信号我有FC, 我们会看到的他们是吗？这里的扇区好吧，它在问你但问题是说展示一下百事可乐的余弦波振荡频率乘以相同的函数留住你，我觉得弯曲可能我们知道同样的函数，第二项是理想低通滤波器的脉冲响应我们招募以前的节目哪个会有在，对不起，频率响应看起来像这样这是理想的低通滤波器是在如果你在时域中乘以事物在频域中

If you convolution in the frequency domain cosine wave looks like that. You have to people's confidenceThese two guys concluding that this thing. Okay It's like you that then apply this definition of impulse response to be treated as a. This is the general responseBut the how's response of the linear system? And because these two inputs you have the input herethen the output would look like this. But centered at this position If that's the impulse response. And if you have an impulse here then you would have that rectangular shape centered at this provision Similarly, if you have it impulse here If the impulse responses, something like that, and you will have the output that looks like thisBut center that this position one more details that if the height of these two impulses are 0.5 The output will be scaled by a factor of 2.5 The amplitude is lowered by halfbut the shape is kept to changeBecause you're just having to imposeAnd this is the ideal bank has humor Now, this is the same frequency domain We can do things in whatever domain likeIt is a if you're happy with the definition of people's response you're just doing this mathematical cooperation of evolutionIt is to be the result into the result of the first in house. And this will be the result of the second half But if you now look at this frequency response within is FC minus tau over two in the range of that to the frequency FC plus tau over twoIt has a constant frequency responsewhich is not zeroAnd for other frequenciesit has zero It's going figure out everything that is outside this frequency that this is an ideal than a student.  My.Christmas, I don't know Feel free to stop me if you any questionsBut for any of these are reviews maybe they are fine This is ideal fantasy. So we're going to use this Perhaps this is the last assessment So this this is asking you to calculate the fourier series representation of his heroic square away I want you to just say rectangular pulses In the lecture, we have such a periodic signalbut that signals even so that is is rectangle is even with respect to the Y axisRight? In that case,  we got a an even number of cosine waves with these C ns But we have no faith for each of the ends. The face will be zero. If you don't need to apply any face 4% to these full time waves

如果你卷积在频域中，余弦波看起来是这样。你必须人们的信心这两个家伙结论是这件事好的就像你一样那然后应用脉冲响应的这一定义，将其视为。这是一般的反应。但是线性系统的响应如何？和因为这两个输入你在这里有输入。则输出将如下所示。但是以此位置为中心如果这是脉冲响应。如果你有冲动那你就会。以此规定为中心的矩形形状同样，如果你有它这里的冲动如果脉冲响应，就像这样，你就会得到输出看起来像这样。但把它放在中间这个位置一个更详细的如果这两种冲动的高度是0.5输出将按2.5的系数进行缩放振幅降低一半但形状保持不变去改变因为你只是不得不强加和这是理想的银行有幽默感。现在，这是相同的频域我们可以在任何领域做事情。它是一个如果你对人们反应的定义满意，你只是在做这个数学的合作进化这是要把结果变成第一个结果的房子。和这将是下半场的结果。但是如果你现在看这个频率响应在里面是FC减去Tau除以2在频率FC+的范围内Tau大于2它有一个常数。频率响应哪个不是零？以及用于其他频率它有零它走了弄清楚每件事在这个频率之外这是一个比理想还理想的学生。我的。圣诞节，我不知道请随时阻止我，如果你任何问题但其中任何一个都是评论。也许他们很好。这是理想的幻想。所以我们要用这个也许这是最后一次评估。所以这个这是要求你计算傅里叶级数表示。他的英雄事迹摆好架势我只想让你说矩形脉冲。在讲座中，我们有这样一个周期信号。但即便如此，这也是信号。那是矩形相对于Y轴为偶数对的？在这种情况下，我们用这些CNS得到了偶数个余弦波但我们对每一个结局都没有信心。面将为零。如果你不需要申请任何脸4%, 到这些全时波

Because that signal was even it wasn't even fun. But now this period of signals delayed a little bit for that For that, because there's a delay. You need to delay all this cosine components in the fourier series of education to delay those who just we would have some face nonzero face herWhen you evaluate the pellucid certificationwhich would give you the face spectrum of this periodic signal But on the other hand, it's it's kind of easy to guess what the fate would be, because how much delay this GT function comes from this stability that it has to be delayed by pi over four Basically, if you have the fourier series representation of this wtand just delay all the cosine waves by Iowa four. Definitely The base gives you delay That's one That's one observation you can tell from this exercise I think it's a exercisesother I've already mentioned the battery of this rectangle of house One complicated way to define a bandwidth is just the midst of the manualBut because this is a based on signal The main lobby surround frequency is zero The negative frequency doesn't really mean anything face The family will be just kids which of these thing, which is one of the town when the period of that kind of house is how there are other ways of defining bandwidthwhich is kind of application depending it depends on the signal that from the frequency spectrum of the signal you might see that the bandwidth is defined, by the waywhere the amplitude is dropped by three DB with respect to the take.  They do It is another way of defining badness. But if they think this range, you still have most of the energy campaigns

因为那信号很均匀一点都不好玩。但是现在这段时间的信号延迟有一点为了那个因为有一个延迟。你需要推迟这一切。余弦组件教育的傅立叶级数拖延那些正义的人我们在这里会有一些非零面当你评估透明认证这会给你面谱这个周期信号。但另一方面，这是很容易猜测命运会是什么，因为有多少延迟？这个GT功能来了。从这个稳定它必须延迟π超过4基本上，如果你有这个WT的傅里叶级数表示延迟所有的余弦。爱荷华州海浪四肯定的基地给你延迟。那是一个这是你可以观察到的一个现象。从这个练习中我认为这是一个练习其他的我已经提到了电池。这个长方形的房子。定义带宽的一种复杂方法就在手册中。但因为这是一个基于信号主大厅环绕频率为零负频率并不真的意味着任何事情，面对这个家庭将只是孩子。这些中的哪些事情，这是其中的一个城市当那个时期的那种房子是怎样的？还有其他的定义带宽的方法这取决于应用程序。这取决于信号。从信号的频谱你可能会看到。顺便说一下，带宽已定义其中振幅已删除三分贝关于索取他们有这是定义坏的另一种方式。但如果他们认为这个范围，你仍然有大部分的能源运动

That's another way There are other ways to define benefits, but yeah, not Detailing down here But the first way we will mainly use the first way of defining that with because we will be using thisThe type of house then is think it is transformed from which is the same function or not I bear in mind that this is it's basicThe bank of the frequencies spectrum is centered at frequency zero.  This is a phase then signal. And when you in this case, the fact that is defined by like thisThe weather is strange. Okay, one over time Very similar to the way that we obtain thatI do band pass filter This GT multiplied by cosine two pi zero ke It's a way perform modulation We observe that if you have an ideal low pass filter if you multiply the impulse response of that, the cosine wave of a high frequency and the frequency spectrumwhich used to be a AA rectangular shape centered frequency zero will be moved to a higher frequency

那是另一种方法还有其他方法来定义利益，但是是的。不在这里详细说明但是第一种方法，我们将主要使用第一种方法来定义，因为我们将使用这个那么房子的类型是认为它是从哪个功能相同或不相同的地方改造而来的。我记得这是这是基本的频率库光谱中心位于频率零点。这是一个相位然后信号当你在这种情况下，由定义的事实像这样天气很奇怪。好的，一次结束。非常类似于我们的方式拿到那个我做带通滤波器这个GT乘以余弦2π零克这是一种方法执行调制我们观察到如果你有一个理想的低通滤波器如果你乘以它的脉冲响应，高频的余弦波和频谱它曾经是一个AA矩形形状中心频率为零会被感动到更高的频率。

And this case is similar that if you have agtif it used to be a baseband signal that has frequencyStatue of the next looks like thisbut it is centered at zeroAs soon as zerowhen he for jk And GT multiplied by cosine too highF one P would if your frequency spectrum that looks like daysFor forget about all the things, we will give you a previous spectrum that is center at that one It will also give you something at minus F one If it is real, then you have to complicate symmetry The negative frequency just keep facing creation. So and because of conjugate symmetry,  the negative frequency is the conjugate of the positive frequency components If you have the positive frequency components, you can specify the negative frequency component When I'm trying to say that it is sufficient across the positive treatment If GD is freeBut you need to have the conjugate symmetry That there's a relationship between the negative frequency component and the quality of frequency component The conjugation take account It gives you the negative difference For real signal to this, it is sufficient to specify the positive frequency components If you multiply GT with a cosine, wait of a high enough frequency You moveDid you suppose G TS used to be a? And suppose GD is a base and signal that has a frequency step on around zero frequencythen after that multiplication the componentsIt's shifted. You have one This is amplitude,  this is anchorage formulation to say that a cosine wave is a carrier signalIt is going to carry the information bearing signal GTGt is the modulated signalIt is going to modulate the amplitude of that cosine wave If you like, it is going to change the amplitude of the carry a signal

和这种情况是类似的。如果你有AGT如果它以前是基带信号那已经频率下一个雕像看起来像这样但它以零为中心。一到零点当他为JK且Gt乘以余弦太高F一P将要如果你的频谱看起来天为了忘记所有的事情，我们会给你一个以前的光谱，以那个为中心。它也会给你一些负1的东西。如果它是真实的，那么你必须使对称复杂化。负频率只是继续面对造物。那么也因为共轭对称，负频率是正频率分量的共轭如果有正频率分量，则可以指定负频率分量当我试着说这就足够了。积极的治疗如果GD是免费的但你需要有共轭对称负频率分量之间存在某种关系和频率分量的质量共轭考虑它给了你负面的差异。对于此的真实信号，指定以下内容就足够了正频率分量如果你将GT乘以余弦等待足够高的频率你动你以为GTS以前是A吗？且假设GD是碱基和信号有一个频率步进在零频率附近然后在那个乘法之后组件它移动了。你有一个这是振幅，这是锚定公式。这么说余弦波是载波信号它将携带信息承载信号GTGT是调制信号它将调节余弦波振幅如果你愿意，它会改变的。的振幅携带信号

That is the module. G is the modulated things. And the GT times the cosine waveIt's called the modulated signalIt's like a signal after modulationAfter you have complete this change of the amplitude of the everything In its term has been modulated signal. Thank you Again, if GT is baseband signalngt multiplied by cosine wave with assuming that is carrier frequencies high enough By high enough, I you see it that one is too smallThen history is getting too close to zero frequency. Thank youWho were met with the make it difficult to be both of the same signal, which is no good Assume that F one is taking out such that there isn't a significant overlap between the positive copy and the negative copythen the modulated signal is going to be a band pass signal

这就是模块。G是调制的事物和GT乘以余弦波它被称为调制信号。它就像调制后的信号在你有了完成此更改的振幅每件事就其而言，已调制信号谢谢同样，如果GT为基带信号NGT乘以余弦波假设那是足够高的载波频率通过足够高，我你看，那个太小了。然后历史太接近零频率了。谢谢谁遇到了让它变得困难两个信号都一样，这是不好的假设F 1被取出，使得不存在显著的重叠在正面拷贝和负面拷贝之间则调制信号将是带通信号

Now, if we change the frequency of the carrier signal,  you can move you can move the frequency spectrum of the modulated signal. But here there wherever you fish, depending on the their single it, depending on the carrier frequencyyou can set a number of carrier frequencies, can say any of them and assume that all these F one, F three, they are separated enough such that GT times cosine two pi have one TThe frequency spectrum that does not overlap with the frequency spectrum, G 2 times. So trying to back up two keys as an overlap with that, I think we're going backEccentrics If these all these frequency spectrumsAll these are based on, sorry, bank as signals are not overlap in the frequency domain

现在，如果我们改变载波信号的频率，可以移动你可以移动调制信号的频谱。但这里那里无论你在哪里钓鱼取决于他们的单曲它取决于载波频率您可以设置多个载波频率，可以说其中任何一个假设所有这些F 1，F 3，它们足够分离这样的Gt乘以余弦2π有一个T与频谱不重叠的频谱G, 2次。所以试着备份两个密钥作为一个重叠，我想我们要回去了怪人如果这些所有这些频谱所有这些都是基于，对不起，银行作为信号不重叠在频域中

Then what you can do is that you can have S one, S two up to snAnd difference message bearing signals that might come from any different persons that different things they modulate any different various signals after this population, they are activThey meet each otherand the input of the channel they added together and assume that China's ideal day get out there that makes its way to the output of the channel and have a splitter here, which is basically duplicating the output of the channel by 10 times. It has beenI think, identical duplicates of the output of the channelAnd then what you can do at the output, suppose that as one The first guy at the transmitter is trying to talk for the first time at the receiver the second guy is trying to talk to the second time that the receiver takes better, et cetera The first guy, what they can doit's still I am either send us filter that theater sound everything from F two F three to fn

那么你能做的就是你可以有S 1，S 2直到Sn和差异消息承载信号这可能来自不同的人，不同的事情。他们调节任何不同的各种信号在这个人口之后，他们是主动的他们见面了。他们把通道的输入加在一起。并假设中国理想的一天从那里出去，进入通道的输出。这里有一个分离器，基本上正在复制通道的输出增加了10倍。它一直是我想，一模一样重复通道的输出然后你可以在输出端做什么，假设那作为一个第一个站在发报机前的人想说话。第一次在接收器上第二个人正试图与第二次，接收器更好，等等。第一个人，他们能做什么它仍然是我任一将过滤器发送给我们那剧院声音一切从F二F三到FN

Just keep the signal around at oneBut if you have a at this pointat this., you have a that has filter that is centered at F one I assume we are capable of using, I feel bad as filter centered at F oneSo that frequent that frequency response of the bank as favorable to be a that kind of shape that looks like this That thing multiplied with these thingsAll these things will appear at the input of the spam house filterBecause the spirit is duplicating the output of the check. And if you go to the channel is the summation of all these related signals do you have? And then how to sing. But if this just filters out the first time, the first component hereBut it takes the component at that oneThey were both group everything

保持就好一点左右的信号但如果你有一个在这点上在这个。你有一个那有过滤器以f 1为中心。我想我们是。有能力使用，我觉得作为过滤器不好。以F 1为中心从而使频谱库频率响应为有利的看起来像这样的形状那东西成倍增加用这些东西这些东西都会出现。在垃圾邮件之家过滤器的输入端因为精神是复制检查的输出和如果你去通道是所有这些的总和。你有相关信号吗？和那怎么唱？但是如果这个只是过滤掉第一次，这里的第一个组件但它需要组件在那一个。他们都是团体的一切。

And then we haven't talked about that the modulation of this component But at least we have these components left for this demodulation by the modulation would mean the rivers of motivationThe motivation is that we use GT to modulate the carrier signalThe modulation means that we get GT back from the modulated signal In that case After dispense has filteringwe get S one T multiplied by cosine two pi and one here That would be the only modulated signal that after this, then pass filter The next step is to demodulate that gives us S one P For the first guy, he's able to talk up with the first kind of the receiver without listening to all the other 10-1 seconds The other players of the communication link are similar for the second guy

然后我们还没有谈到这个的调制成分但至少我们有。这些组件离开了对于这种解调调制意味着动机的河流。其动机是我们使用GT来调制载波信号调制意味着我们从调制信号中得到GT那样的话分配后具有过滤功能我们得到S1T乘以这里是余弦2π和1这将是唯一的调制信号在此之后，然后通过筛选下一步是解调给了我们一个P对于第一个人来说，他会说话用第一种接收器没有听着其他所有10-1秒通信链路的其他参与者第二个人也是如此。

It has a band pass filter center, adaptiveso that hospital would have frequency response that looks like that, the rectangle of state multiplied multiplying this frequency rateSo everyone will be gone at three and then maybe gone only basis that this has two times cosine two. I have to the then you modulate that modulated signal This thing in this system here, we are doing frequency divisionmultiplexingWe are using the same channel to carry bank has signals center at different frequencies in a way that all these bank has still not overlap with each other In the time domainwe've had all these signals together. You have any different time to make signals headed together In the time domain, it appears that they are all mixedthat all makes up that it seems to be interfering with each other But we can separate them at the receiver by applying appropriate band pass filters and then do the demodulation We are a kind of reusing the channel by assigning different message bearing signals at different frequency bands That is and which is term as frequency division multiplex Ii guess it's time for a break.  Let's take a break for 10 minutes

它有一个带通滤波器中心，自适应所以医院会有频率响应看起来像这样，状态的矩形乘以乘以这个频率速率所以每个人都会在三点离开，然后可能会离开。唯一的基础是这是余弦二的两倍。我有到然后你调制那个调制信号。在这个系统中，我们正在进行分频。多路复用我们用的是同一个频道。来携带银行有不同频率的信号中心。在某种程度上，所有这些银行都还是不行互相重叠在时域中我们已经得到了所有这些信号。你们有没有不同的时间来发出一致的信号？在时域中，它们似乎都是混合的这一切都说明它似乎在相互干扰。但是我们可以在接收器上把它们分开。通过应用适当的带通滤波器和然后进行解调我们是一种重复使用。频道通过分配不同频带上的不同消息承载信号那是且其被称为频分复用我想该休息一下了。我们休息10分钟吧。

The ants person will do is that if you apply a band pass filter that filters out only the ends signal at the center,  at Mall this thing will be removed by that hospitalsuch that at the output of this pass filter, it will have SN multiplied by cosine two pi fnp, which is modulated signal from the nth person on the left The ads first is modulated at carrier signal of FM frequencyOkay. So the experts on the right will get that modulated signal,  and then it has to perform the modulation on S Mt multiplied by cosine to fnt It's going to obtain S nt,  the experts on the right will release the only listen to SNP If there's one problem telephone line that all these 30 signals will have through at the same time in the time you make this 30 signals from the leftthey are mixed upadded together kind of when you can't tell them

蚂蚁的人会做的。那是如果应用带通滤波器只过滤掉末端。信号在中心，在我所有这些东西都会被医院移走使得在该带通滤波器的输出处，它将具有Sn乘以余弦二pi fnp，即为调制信号从左边第N个人开始ADS首先被调制为载波信号调频频率好的。所以右边的专家会明白。调制信号，然后它必须执行调制上S mt乘以余弦到fnt它将获得S NT，右边的专家将发布唯一的听SNP如果有一个问题所有这30个信号的电话线会有通过同时在你从左边发出30个信号的时间里他们搞混了。加在一起你不能告诉他们的时候

It concept,  it seems that you cannot separate them apart. They are all summed upBut in the frequency domain if you select is carrier frequencies properlysuch that all these band pass signals do not overlap with each other Then at each of the receivers, at the right group, you can apply a proper band pass filter to to obtain the signal that any person on the right is interested in and then perform the motivation Of course, if you have 30 individual lines among these 30 pairs of people. And they don't care about frequency division of the cracks.  You don't leave a border to reuseThe frequency is almost single communication checkIf you have 30 in these separate channels, you don't bother to do thisThis is just to reuse 1 single channel at different frequency bands You see multi taxi who you are you're sharing a common channel for different users We've mentioned that we need brand pass filters here that pass filter can be obtained by multiplying the impulse response of ideal low pass filter with the cosine wave of the desired frequency. Byebye. Thank you very much Which is basically this if this is the ideal low pass filter frequency response in the time from when you multiply that with the cosine wave frequency domainthe cosine wave has two impulseswill be concluded with this thing You will obtain that 2 years. There are FC we've mentioned that the bandwidth of this ideal bank pass filter is from here to here,  which is how if this would be a signal rather than filters frequency response That's going to be a so called band passThe work has passed and said, noand depend of such a signal

在概念上，你似乎不能把它们分开。都是总结出来的。但是在频域中如果您选择载波频率是否正确这样的所有这些带通信号彼此不重叠然后在每个接收器上，在正确的组中，您可以应用适当的带通滤波器至获得的信号右边的任何人都有兴趣然后执行激励当然，如果你有30个单独的线路在这些之中30对人。和他们不关心裂缝的频率划分。您不会留下可重复使用的边框。频率几乎是单一的。通信检查如果你在这些单独的频道里有30个，你就不用费心去做这个了。这只是为了重复使用。 1, 单通道在不同的频段你看多出租车你是谁你们在分享一个共同的通道针对不同的用户我们已经提到，我们需要品牌通过过滤器在这里。该通带滤波器可以通过以下方式获得: 乘以理想余弦波低通滤波器的冲激响应所需频率的拜拜非常感谢基本上是这样的。这是理想的低通滤波器频率响应当你把它与余弦波频域相乘时，余弦波有两个脉冲。将以这件事结束。你将获得2年。有FC我们提到过这个的带宽理想的岸通滤波器是从这里到这里也就是怎样如果这是一个信号而不是滤波器频率响应那将是一个所谓的带通。工作已经过去了，说，没有。和依赖这样的信号。

It's going to be it's slightly different from the face that case If it had a basement, your frequency component is centered at zero In that case, the bandwidth is just from B to the.that is that is zero for the same case to the first thing for the same time But in this case, it's obvious that beyond this., there's nothing left. So so the bad means it should be stressed for baseband signals for past and positive frequencies do make senseOkay. So the banquet is doubled as compared to this If this is based on modulated signal you use this to modulate a cosine wave high in the frequency, and you complain thisAnd the fact that is doubled comes it is a speedThe benefits of that is to be because positive frequencies do make sense

这将是它和那个案子的脸略有不同。如果它有一个地下室，你的频率分量以零为中心在这种情况下，带宽正好来自B对.那是那是零为同一案件到第一件事同一时间但在这种情况下，很明显，除了这个，什么都没有留下。那么所以坏的意思是应该强调。用于基带信号对于过去和积极的频率确实有意义。好的。那么酒席加倍。与此相比如果这是基于调制信号你用这个来调制余弦波。频率很高，你还抱怨这个。而事实是是两倍来了这是一种速度。这样做的好处是因为正频率确实有意义。

YeahIi should have realized there's a slide here This is what This complex conjugate of a real signal means. And the frequency spectrum of a real signal satisfied is conjugate symmetry propertysuch that if sf S minus FWhat I,  if sf, and F is positive as minus that, where minus that is the-50, so called negative frequenciesWe just take the conjugate of the positive frequency So that means that for real signalsyou may simply specify the positive frequency componentsThe negative frequency components are implied by the conjugate symmetry propertyOkayThat was one way of doing modulation Amplitude modulation Later on, if we will giveit doesn't nameIt's perhaps the same list way of doing motivation, but it has a very long name But in general we will have this cosine two pi fct as the carrier signal This carry signal, this cosine wave has three components If we write a cosine wave at the general cosine wave that looks like thisit has an amplitude. 18 which we used to assume that it is constantIt is constant, but doesn't necessarily have to be we have AFC, which is the instantaneous frequency that cosine wave We have this itwhich is the face of this cosine wave. I have three components of such a terrorist signalAnd let's say MHe is our message bearing signalOr in other words, the modulated signalwe can use Mt to change at to change the amplitudewhich gives us average modulation We have seen one very simple way of doing that, just empty, multiply by the cosine fail

是啊我应该意识到这里有一张幻灯片这是什么实信号的复共轭意味着。和实信号的频谱满足是共轭对称性质使得如果SFS减去F如果SF和F为正，则I为作为负数，其中负数是-50，所谓的负频率我们只需取正频率的共轭。那么这意味着对于真实信号您可以简单地指定正频率分量负频率分量为所暗示的共轭对称性质好的那是一种进行调制的方法调幅稍后，如果我们愿意它没有名字这可能是同一份名单。做激励的方式，但它有一个很长的名字我们将把这个余弦二pi FCT作为载波信号这载波信号，该余弦波有三个组成部分如果我们在一般的余弦波上写一个余弦波，就像这样。它有一个振幅。18, 我们曾经假设它是常数。它是不变的，但是不一定非得是我们有AFC，它是余弦波的瞬时频率我们有这个。哪个是脸？这个余弦波。我有三个组成部分。的如此恐怖的信号和让我们说M他是我们传递信息的信号。或者换句话说，调制信号我们可以使用MT来更改AT改变振幅这给了我们平均调制。我们已经看到了一种非常简单的方法，只要空，乘以余弦失败。空，乘以余弦为空。现在表示

Empty, multiply by cosine to empty. Now represents the amplitude of the carrier signalThe carrier signal used to be having a constant activity. But now a constant maximum benefitBut for now that the amplitude is changing according to Mnotify employees with the cosine waveThat's when there were, anyway,  if you are going to change the amplitude of the culture, if you're just changing the average of the carry signal using empty and motivating signalI think it's empty modulationIf you are going to use the modulated signal to change the instantaneous frequency of the cosine wavethen you have frequency motivationIf you're going to use the motivating signal to change the face of the cosine wave, then you have phase modulationThey did these two things will end up more 30

载波信号幅度载波信号过去具有恒定的活动。但是现在不变的最大利益但现在振幅是根据M变化的通知员工用余弦波无论如何，如果你要改变振幅，如果你只是改变文化的平均值使用空和激励信号进位信号我认为这是空调制如果你要用调制信号来改变瞬时频率余弦波的。那么你就有了频率动机。如果你要用改变面貌的激励信号余弦波的，然后你有相位调制。他们做了这两件事更多30但我们会讨论这个的。

But we'll talk about this to make supreme motivation lateIt is going to be a bit more complicated than empty population We will see that But these two later categories,  frequency modulation, and phase modulationand be collectively known as angle modulation.  If you if you treat the terms in this programme, that's the angleAnd then congratulations At least you hopefully you take away that the concept that modulation is to use a message bearing signal to change some aspect of a carrier signalThere is going to modulate the carrier signal to modulate something about the carrier signal you feel free to usechange the word change to replace observationYeah, you're not going to use a message bearing signal to change some aspects of the carrier signal The modulation is the reverse You're going to extract the modulated signal from the modulated signal Simplest perhaps the same list, empty modulation schemeand T multiplied by ST, assuming that ST is AC times the cosine wave with the frequency of FC which is basically what we haveWe use it before. It is called double side suppressed carrier amplitude modulationIt's so simple in math, but it's so long in pain Big words In terms of the frequency spectrum, it looks like that This is the frequency spectrum for close that way. And assume that your modulated signal it's the best friends that looks like this in the frequency domain that these two guys conclude with each otherthat gives you that we know that for the face that case, we have this for a positive frequency and negative frequency If these two guys are conjugate symmetry to each otherIf your message bearing signal is realwhich would be the case for real applications After modulation the negative frequency part also appear being out on the positive frequency axis We name name this as the upper side that and make that as the lower suck, thenSo after modulationthe lower side then also appears in the positive frequency, part of the of the frequency axis When we calculate the banquet when we discuss the families of the modulated signal we will have to take both the upper side and the lower side band into account with the bandwidth is doubled Compared to the face and face We have two side plans for the baseband signal. And these two sides that appears in the positive frequency after modulation This modulation scheme is called double side band That's where the double side that why the double side bend Why there's a double sideband in the name of this modulation scheme Also there's another middle part of the name called which as big as suppressed carrier You see, the frequency spectrum is modulated signalThere isn't component that suggests the existence of the cosine wave we'll see later that we will going to introduce another happy to motivation scheme for assemble Corlettconventional Entity motivation schemewhere you will see too impulsive at the frequency spectrum of motivated signalHere you don't see two impulses For cosine wave, you have to emphasis one at see the other at minus FC But for this particular caseyou don't see two impulsesFfc. Thank you To differentiate these two ways of doing M PT modulation. We call this suppressed carrier The full name is double sized press carrierAmazing motivation. Ok simply explain this. You have so now we have a modulated signal, which is double sideband suppressed carrierdsbsc am

迟来的最高动机这将是一个比人口空虚更复杂一点。我们会看到的但是后面的两类，频率调制和相位调制统称为角度调制。如果你如果你在这个节目中处理术语，那就是角度。然后恭喜你至少你希望你能把它拿走。调制的概念是用一个信息承载信号来改变一些载波信号方面将调制载波信号对载波信号进行调制您可以随意使用更改“更改”一词以替换"观察是啊，你不会用带有改变信号的信息载波信号的一些方面调制是相反的。你要去从所述调制信号中提取所述调制信号最简单也许是相同的列表，空调制方案和T乘以ST，假设ST是AC乘以余弦波频率为FC这基本上是我们所拥有的。我们以前用过。它被称为双边抑制载波调幅它在数学上如此简单，但在痛苦中却如此漫长。大词就频谱而言，它看起来是这样的这是以这种方式关闭的频谱。和假设你的调制信号看起来像这样的是最好的朋友。在频域中，这两个人互相总结这给了你我们知道在那个案子里，我们有这个对于正频率和负频率如果这两个人是彼此共轭对称如果你的信息承载信号是真实的这将是实际应用的情况。调制后负频部分也出现在正频率轴上我们命名将此命名为上面那个让它成为下吸盘，然后所以调制之后然后下侧也出现在正频率中部分的频率轴的当我们计算宴会的时候当我们讨论调制信号族时，我们将不得不将上侧和下侧频带都考虑在内带宽增加一倍与脸和脸相比我们有两个计划。用于基带信号。和出现的这两面在调制后的正频率中这种调制方案称为双边带那就是双面的地方为什么是双侧弯？为什么在这个调制方案的名称中有一个双边带？也这个名字的另一个中间部分叫做哪一与抑制载波一样大你看，频谱是调制信号没有成分这表明了余弦波的存在。稍后我们将介绍另一个快乐的激励计划召集科利特传统实体激励方案在那里你会看到太冲动了在激励信号的频谱上在这里你看不到两个脉冲对于余弦波，你必须强调一个在看到另一个在负FC但对于这个特殊的案例。你看不到两种冲动FFC, 谢谢区分这两种做法M PT调制。我们称其为抑制载波全名是双倍大小的新闻载体。惊人的动力好吧简单地解释一下这个。你有这么现在我们有一个调制信号，即双边带抑制载波DSBSC, 是我们想要得到

We want to get the modulated signal backHow are we going to do that This is the modulated signalwhich would be empty multiplied by cosine two pi fct What you can suppose at the receiver sideyou can regenerateWe can generate the same cosine lead that the same carrier signalthen what you can do is to multiply them terrorist signal with the modulated signal after that multiplication with some trigonometric identities you can work out that that this times Mt times one plus the cosine four pi X city as the result of that application

调制信号返回我们要怎么做？这是调制信号它将是空的乘以余弦二pi FCT你能做的假设在接收器侧你可以再生我们可以生成相同的余弦导联同样的载波信号那么你能做的就是把它们相乘。带有调制信号的恐怖分子信号在与一些三角恒等式相乘之后你可以健身。那这个乘以mt乘以1加余弦。四Pi X城市作为该申请的结果如果你看频谱

If you look at the frequency spectrum of the results You have empty, multiplied by onewhich is empty itself You will have he is a frequency spectrum and tea at the base therebecause you have emptyBut you also have another term empty, multiply by cosine four pi fct It's like you are modulated carrier signal with frequency of two FC using MP you will have this and that as a result of the second term, empty multiply by cosine four pi fctAnd with that If that results and with the objective that we just want empty bag what we can do is to apply a low pass filter.  In this case Just to keep the base then single You can do that then we get some feedbackAny questions hereThen they are trying to get empty bag from from this xesb Which I should have defined it. It willYeah, so this xdsvt is the modulated signalsome constant times MP, which is the modulated signal, multiplied by the carry signalAnd from from this signal, we want to get empty back That is the purpose of communication The transmitter wants to come away empty to the receiverIt does not mean MP times cosine wave. It just needs emptyYou have to remove, somehow have to remove the cosine wave from the modulated signalAnd if we can if we do have the same area signal at the receiverthen we can use this so called coherent detection.  We multiply the modulated signal with the same carrier signal We use a low pass filter We get MPNow, if this way of doing the motivation requires exactly the same terrorist signal and the receiver side as compared to the transmitters carrier signal

结果你有空的，乘以1它本身是空的。你会有的他是频谱和茶叶基地的一员。因为你有空的但你还有另一项是空的，乘以余弦四。就像你被调制了一样载波信号两个FC的频率使用MP你会有这个和那个。由于第二项，空乘以余弦四pi FCT有了这个如果结果和目标是我们只想要空袋子我们可以做的是应用低通滤波器在这种情况下只是为了保住基地。单身的那你可以这么做。我们得到一些反馈这里有任何问题然后他们试图得到空袋子从从这个XESB我应该给它下个定义。它会的是啊，所以该XDSVT是调制信号一些常数乘以MP（即调制信号），再乘以进位信号还有从从这个信号来看，我们想要得到空的回报这就是沟通的目的。发送者想要空手离开接收者。它不是指MP乘以余弦波。它只需要空的。你必须以某种方式去除余弦波。从调制信号中和如果我们可以如果我们确实有接收器处的相同区域信号那我们可以用这个。所谓的相干检测我们乘以具有相同载波信号的调制信号我们使用低通滤波器我们得到了MP现在，如果这种激励方式需要完全相同的恐怖分子信号和接收方与发射机相比载波信号如果这两个人

If these two guysit is to carry signals the carrier signal at the transmitter and the carrier signal at the receiver are if they are different If there's an amplitude difference at that. you just multiply the constantThat's fineBut if there would be a frequency error of Delta F If there is a phased error of Ythen you generate you try to generate the same carrier signal at the receiver, but he failed to do that to generate something elseThe journal of terrorist signal with the frequency error of Delta X and the face area of fiveIf that's the case you do a little bit of math are using triple metric identities You get you get these two termsBut if you get this empty, multiply by a cosine way that has a oscillating frequency of Delta L The phase term here you also have this term

它是用来传递信号的。处的载波信号如果发射机和接收机的载波信号不同，如果在那里有一个振幅差。你只要乘以常数。那很好但是如果存在频率误差德尔塔F如果存在y的相位误差然后你生成你试着在接收器上产生同样的载波信号，但是他没能做到这一点来产生其他东西。频率误差为△X的恐怖分子信号杂志面部面积为5如果是这样的话你做了一点数学计算，使用三重度量恒等式。你得到你得到这两个术语但如果这个是空的，乘以A余弦方法那有一个Delta L的振荡频率这里的相位项你也有这个术语。由于该乘法，Do是载波信号。你有一个更高的频率成分，类似于前面的情况。

Do due to this multiplication is the carrier signal. You have an even higher frequency component similar to the previous case is a frequency of two FC plus Delta FNow that this term is okay, because you can remove that using a low pass filter. But the and the first term is problematicIf you see that you wanted empty, but now empty is multipliedlike it's cosine two pi Delta xt plus five Let's assume that you you're not too badRegenerating the same carrier signal such that it's Delta T is relatively small This is going to corrupt the motivating thing if you have time to multiply 5 days and you cannot we cannot really get rid of thisIn that case it is IQWe are doing this epidemic modulation is a really small carrier carrier frequency the positive part and negative part overlapping with each other

是两个FC加上Δf的频率现在这一项是可以的，因为你可以使用低通滤波器来消除它。但是第一学期呢？有问题如果你看到你想要空，但现在空是乘的。就像它是余弦二πδxT+5让我们假设你你不算太坏。重新生成相同的载波信号，使其ΔT相对较小这将是腐败如果你有时间乘以5天，那就是激励的事情。而你不能我们无法真正摆脱它。那样的话这是智商我们正在做的这个流行病调节是一个非常小的载体载波频率积极部分和消极部分相互重叠情况不妙

It's not good That's the case We want to introduce this term called coherent detection which means that if you can regenerate the exactly the same carrier signal, if Delta F is zero and five is zero you do that. You multiply the risk, the modulated signal with the carrierAnd then you do the pass figure that is called coherent detection. OkayOne single way of trying to avoid this issue is that you transmit the same carrier signalIn other transmitter, you do your modulation Then before you send the modulated signal, you send the carrier signal as wellso that the receiver can to receive the same carrier signal. You don't have you send that carry signal as a pilot that comes beforeYour motivated signal and the receiverwe first try to extract the carrier signal from the pilot and use that we can carry signal to youCoherent detection

情况就是这样我们想介绍这个术语称为相干检测这意味着，如果你能重新生成完全相同的载波信号，如果ΔF为0，5为0你这样做。你增加了风险，调制信号和载波然后你做一个叫做相干检测好的单一的方式试图回避这个问题。就是你发射同样的载波信号。在其他发射机中，您可以进行调制然后，在发送调制信号之前，还要发送载波信号以便接收器可以来接收相同的载波信号你没有你以飞行员的身份发送这个信号你的激励信号和接收器我们首先尝试提取来自导频的载波信号利用这一点，我们可以向你传递信号相干检测那是一种方法

That's one way of to mitigate this of the problem, not being able to regenerate exactly the same carrier signal Stop me if you have questions that can continue The next and 50 modulation scheme we are going to introduce is 50 so called conventional energy modulation In the form of the modulated signal is a bit different that you are going to multiply AC plus with the carrier signalthe beforehand is like AC multiplied by empty they multiply by cosineBut now you are adding the constant term to the modulated signal Mt You multiply that thing with the carrier signal If you open the bracket you have kc multiplied by cosine wave plus Mt times cosine waveMt times cosine wave is the double side suppressed carrier And 50 modulation are empty modulation signal. And that signal is going to be added by AC times both sides25, CT

来减轻这一点的问题，无法重新生成完全相同的载波信号如果你有问题就打断我。这可以继续下一个我们将要介绍的50调制方案是50所谓的常规能量调制调制信号的形式略有不同你要乘以AC+用载波信号事先就像AC乘由空它们乘以余弦。但现在你在添加常数项到调制信号MT你把它和载波信号相乘。如果你打开括号你有KC乘以余弦波加上MT乘以余弦波MT倍余弦波是双边抑制载波和50调制是空调制信号和该信号将被添加通过交流乘以两侧25CT, 在调制信号中，有余弦，有载波信号分量。

In the modulated signal, you have a cosine, you have a carrier signal componentsIt's AC times cosine to Phi of CT plus something plus the the whole size of carrier modulated signal If you would cross the frequency spectrum of this thing apart from those two triangles that appear in the aspectyou will also have to Delta functionstwo impulse functions. That's fcn minus FCthe frequencies the carrier affairs The carrier is not suppressed The previous case, the carrier is suppressedIt's gone. This is,  but. Byebye That's one difference between this conventional equity modulation and the double side suppressed carrierdouble side bands of rest areas, am The other difference is that with this you can actually perform the modulation using some other mechanism by just looking at that, by just trying to detect the envelope of the modulated signal

它是AC乘以余弦到CT的φ加上某个值再加上载波调制信号的总大小如果你愿意穿越这东西的频谱。除了出现在Aspect中的两个三角形你也必须Delta函数两个脉冲函数。那是FCN减去FC频率承运人事务载波未被抑制在前一种情况下，载波被抑制它不见了。这是，但是拜拜这是传统的公平调节的一个不同之处。和双侧抑制载波休息区双边带，AM另一个不同的是用这个你可以实际执行调制使用其他机制由只是看着它，试着探测信封调制信号的这是我们做的。

Here's what we made If MPthe modulated signal looks like that he would have positive amplitude and negative energy You see,  in the modulation we have to first add a constant turn to empty Assume that this AC is baking powerand AC plus Mt would make the signal always positiveAnd with that signalwe multiply that with the Paris the modulated signal would look like It is going to be obsolete because you have a cosine wave there of clicksBut the envelope of this obsolete signal would resemble the shape of AC plus MP It is oscillating signal is the xam is the modulated signalBut the a positive envelope. RightHave a look that is always positiveis keeping you the shape of AC plus Mt

如果MP调制信号看起来像那他会有正振幅和负能量。你看，在调制中我们必须首先添加不断转向空假设这个交流电是烘焙电源。且AC加上MT将制作信号总是正的。有了这个信号我们乘以那个和巴黎一起调制信号看起来像它将被淘汰，因为这里有一个余弦波。点击但是这个的信封废弃信号会像AC+MP的形状它是振荡信号是XAM是调制信号但是正信封对的看一看总是积极的。让你保持AC+MT的形状如果我们能探测到

If we can detect thattake that ever looked at positive envelope. In this case then we are done, we are fine We don't, in that case, we will introduce that we can have ever so called table of detector that does not require you to generates the keroseneNow,  to be able to use the envelope detectorwe do have to ambition We made is constantBasie to be picking up such that AC plus Mt needs to be always positive. If notIt's not AC plus Mt could be negative sometimes If you use this to modulate the cosine wave if you are detecting the positive envelopethen in the shape changes The positive envelope is not are looking the same as the modulated signal anymoreBecause. Byebye. Part of itOut of empty is hiding in a negative envelope

拿着那个曾经看过的正面信封。在这种情况下那我们就结束了，我们很好。我们没有，在这种情况下，我们将介绍我们可以有所谓的检测器表，不需要你产生煤油现在，能够使用包络检波器我们必须这么做。野心我们做了是恒定的贝西接电话因此AC+MT需要始终为正如果不它不是AC加上MT，有时可能是负的。如果你用这个来调制余弦波如果您正在检测正包络然后在形状变化中正信封不是看起来和不再是调制信号因为拜拜其中一部分出空是藏在一个负信封里。但正如我们将要展示的

But as we will show that the envelope detectors detecting a positive energy If you are going to use envelope detectoryou would need to make sure that this AC is constant termThe amplitude of the carrier signal should be knowledge in a because of that significance of the amplitude of the carrier signal.  We people have declined this modulation index Is defined as the ratio between the maximum amplitude of the modulated signal the amplitude of the carrier signal, which is AC this MP here it's the are maximum amplitude of the modulated signalpresumingwhich means that Mt would take a maximum value of MP, and you will take a minimum value of minus MP It changes between MP and minus MP in the time domain And the ratio between MP and AC gives you a modulation index

包络检波器检测正能量如果您要使用包络检波器你需要确保这个AC是常数项。载波信号的幅度应为知识在A因为那个的意义载波信号幅度我们人们已经降低了这个调制指数。定义为以下两者之间的比率最大值调制信号的幅度载波信号的幅度，即交流这位议员这是是的最大振幅调制信号假设这意味着MT将取最大值MP，而您将取最小值-MP它在MP和负MP之间变化在时域中还有比例在MP和AC之间给你一个调制指数和

And to ensure that the positive envelope of the and between motivated signal campaigns have teaYou would need this modulation indexIt is smaller than or equal to oneOkay? Basically, you need you made this AC to be large enough to to lift the empty curve above zerothe face he needs to be larger than MPsuch that AC minus MP is larger than thetasuch as modulation indexit's going to be smaller than or equal to one There are two examples If we are going to have a cosine wave as more relating signal This is going to be the the AC plus MP.  This is empty The amplitude of empty smaller than AC, in this case,  is half of AC This would be the shape of the modulated signal Without AC, it is oscillating around zeroBut with AC, it is lifted upwards by an amount of AC.

为确保的正包络以及在有动机的信号运动之间喝茶你需要这个调制指数。它小于或等于1好的？基本上你需要你做了这个空调。大到足以举起零以上的空曲线他的脸需要比这更大。下议院议员使得AC减去MP大于θ如调制指数它将小于或等于1。有两个例子。如果我们要有余弦波作为更相关的信号这将是那AC Plus, 下议院议员。这是空的在这种情况下，比AC小的空的振幅是AC的一半这就是形状。调制信号的在没有交流电的情况下，它在零附近振荡但有了空调，它就被解除了。向上增加AC的量。所以这很吸引人。

So that is fascinating like that If this thing is multiplied by the Carissa cosine two pi fct then the modulated signal is going to oscillate faster, assuming the FC started FMModulated signal here is a cosine wave of a smaller frequency FMAnd carrier signal with the frequency of fcfc is going to be much larger than FM The moderating signal is like fascinating, slowerbut the carrier signal stops making much faster And the basis theyright, twice as much as the amplitude and amplitude of the modulated signal that a a positive envelope will contain the shape of MPIn this caseit's at the boundary The amplitude of the modulated signal is equal to AC You are lifting empty just enough to pass the zero barpositive energy still resemble and over the basisa little bit smaller than you are in trouble We are II guess we need some more time to to sort of elaborate what the envelope detector is trying to do But the envelope detector has as a circuit that look like there is, it complains,  in principle, it is simply it just has a diode and a capacitor and resistor The dark hereYou see we you need the voltage on the left hand side is keeping the right hand sides that this is this is a short circuit, otherwise is over 30 That is why it is only detecting the positive bamboo Ii was just briefly summarize that there is some design issue with the capacitance and resistance, because we when when this is going to be an open circuit,  it is arc circuit that will discharge according to some time constants if you are going to have modulated signal that goes up and down when it goes down that diodes become open circuit and ask the service starts to discharge the rate of the discharge is going to affect the output

如果这个乘以卡丽莎余弦二点FCT则调制信号将更快地振荡，假设FC启动FM这里的调制信号是余弦波较小频率FM的频率为FCFC的载波信号将比FM大得多缓和的信号就像是迷人的，缓慢的但是载波信号不再使速度变得更快他们的基础是对，是调制信号幅度和幅度的两倍那A A正信封将包含MP的形状在这种情况下它在边界上。调制信号的幅度等于AC你举起的东西刚好够空的。通过零杆正能量还像完了。的基础比你小一点的就有麻烦了。我们是我想我们需要更多的时间详细说明一下。包络检波器的作用但是包络检波器有作为一个电路，看起来像有，它抱怨，原则上，它很简单，它只有一个二极管，一个电容和电阻这里的黑暗你看我们你需要电压。在左手边是保持右手边，这是这是短路，否则就超过30这就是为什么它只检测阳性的竹子。我只是简短地说总结电容和电阻存在一些设计问题，因为我们当的时候当这将是一个开路时，电弧电路将放电。根据一些时间常数如果你要调制信号，当它下降时，它会上升和下降。二极管变成开路，要求维修人员开始放电。排放的速度将会影响产量如果它太慢会让人分心

If it's going to be distracting too slowlythen as opposed thisthis positive envelope,  this dash line is the realis the modulated signal But as a service is charging too slowly the output signal does not resemble the the modulated signal as a bit of design issue there. But just to make them aware of Anyway, because of this disparaging effect You do not getI do exactly the shape of the modulated signal It is going to discharge a little bit before the input comes up again You will have reports like thisLike those What? 76 photosYou have a bit of ripple like that You may lose out those ripples by using low pass filter because those ripples looks like a as soldiers waitand the source was ready to look at the fourier seriesbig convex, high frequency components.

那么与此相反这个正的信封，这条虚线是真实的是调制信号但作为一项服务，收费太慢了。输出信号与调制信号作为一个小的设计问题。但是只是为了让他们意识到总之，因为这个贬低效果你不明白我精确地做了调制信号的形状。在输入再次出现之前，它会稍微放电。你会有这样的报告。就像那些什么？76张照片你有一点像那样的涟漪。通过使用低通滤波器，您可能会丢失这些纹波因为那些波纹看起来像是士兵们在等待来源已经准备好查看傅立叶级数。大凸，高频分量。如果使用低通滤波器来计算高频分量，

And if you use a low pass filter to figure out the high frequency components the soldiers will be a small step I guess without taking you for the time let's conclude to the statue of a We've introduced to basic everything or religion schemes and discussed the relevant detection,  the demodulationBut why is coherent detection? And the other is the envelope impact Thank you very much. And next time we will who is in the final years I was talking about the a that's exactly

士兵们将迈出一小步。我想不需要你的时间让我们总结一下到A的雕像我们已经介绍了基本的一切或宗教计划。并讨论了相关的检测、解调。但为什么是相干检测？另一个是信封影响。非常感谢。下次我们会的。谁在最后几年？我说的是A那正是
