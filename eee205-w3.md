I've said on the previous slide, I closed the switchAt the moment I closed the switcha load cannot be seen by the source If I look at it as a of an equivalent circuit, I only have generator or the DC source here source impedance, and the impedance of the transmission line That means the size of people, the size of my first voltage to travel over the transportation law is a voltage divided between ten zero and set X I have the voltage source, I have one in instead, Xi have another impedance, said ten zero. The voltage is divided between those two thingsAs the one plus travels of the transmission line,  we can imagine it's a wave and it's traveling off the line everywhere behind the front of the wave is charged to be one person.

我在上一张幻灯片上说过，我关闭了开关。在我合上开关的那一刻源无法看到负载如果我把它看作在等效电路中，我只有发电机或这里的直流电源源阻抗和传输线的阻抗这意味着人的大小，我的第一个电压的大小在运输法上旅行电压是否分为10并设置X我有电压源，我有一个，而Xi有另一个阻抗，表示为10。电压在这两个东西之间分配。当一加在传输线上传播时，我们可以想象它是一个波，它在传输线外传播。后面到处都是波浪的前沿被指控为一个人。

All of these area of traffic light, as we traveled, is charged to be one plus everybody in firms of whether the wave has been is still zero

当我们旅行时，所有这些交通灯的区域都是收费的，加上公司里的每个人。波浪是否已经仍为零

Only as the way passes a point, is that point charged to be more close everywhere in front of the way remains at zeroWhen my wave arrives at the lowthat effectively means the whole transmission line is charged to be one plus every point along the line is now be 1/3What happens nextWhat happens at that.in the interests of saving time and knowing I'm not going to get a responseIf sele does not equals at zero, there will be a reflectionThe reflections are going to call V one minus V one plus traveled in a positive direction and was the first voltage propagating.

只有当道路经过一个点时，该点的电荷才会更加接近道路前方的任何地方，保持为零。当我的波浪到达低处时这实际上意味着整条输电线路收费是1加上沿线的每个点现在是1/3接下来会发生什么发生了什么在那。为了节省时间，我知道我不会得到回应。如果SELE不等于零，则会有反射反射将被称为V1减V1加朝着积极的方向行进是第一个传播的电压。

Now, the first voltage has been reflected by calling it big one minus eight begins to propagate back along the transmission line. It takes time because it takes timeIt'll be very fast, but it will take time as it travels everywhere behind it, from away from will be charged to V one plus V one minus everywhere in front of its way front still remains of V one plus

现在，第一个电压已经通过将其称为大1负来反映。八开始沿着传输线传播回来。它需要时间，因为它需要时间这会很快，但需要时间。当它旅行时它的背后到处都是，从远离将被收费到V一加V一减在它的前面到处都是V一加的痕迹。

My first wave traveled down the line, charging the whole line to be 1 plus. It remains charged to be more closeI've had a reflection. It is now traveling backwardsEverywhere behind that way. Front is now charged to the sum of the one person be one mindEverywhere it is not yet passed, it's just still at V one plusWhen V one minus, when my reflected wave arrives back to the sourcethe whole life is now charged to be one person must be worldwideWhat happens next I'll take the finger switch that I need to solve. Thank youThere is a reflection if then this does not equals at zero, that V one minus will be reflected again We end up with AV two plus traveling back up the transmission line everywhere behind its way front on the transmission line is now charged to V one plus plus V one minus plus V two plusAnd everywhere in front of the wave front remains at V one plus B for finals

我的第一波沿着线路移动，将整条线路充电为1+。它仍然被要求更接近。我有一个倒影。它现在正在向后移动。那条路后面到处都是。前面是现在收费的总和，一人一心无论在哪里，它都还没有通过，它只是还在V一加。当V 1-，当我的反射波回到源时。整个人生现在收费是一个人，必须是全世界的。接下来会发生什么我要解决手指开关的问题。谢谢有一个反射，如果它不等于零，那么V1-将再次被反射。我们最终得到了AV 2 Plus，它沿着传输线往回走在输电线前面，它后面的所有地方现在都被充电到V一加加V一减加V二加在波的前面到处都是。留在V一加B进入决赛。

This will go on and on and on and onbouncing back and forwards and adding components together again and again and againRememberingin most casesgamma L and gamma S, the reflection coefficients will be less than typically less than more. Unless you have an open circuit or a short circuit, there will be less than one Each reflection will get smaller and smaller and smallerAnd after a number of reflectionsthe size of the way bouncing back and forwards will be negligible and ignore it because it's so smallAt that. what we're saying is steady state has been written The transient period starts when I close the switch and my wave sets off it ends when the size of the reflection becomes negligibleNow, you've seen this previouslyTechnically,  you use a the value of 5 times the time constant for the circuit when we're not getting that complex herewe just accept that this is the case

这将继续下去，继续下去。来回跳动，一次又一次地将组件添加到一起回忆在大多数情况下γL和γS，则反射系数将小于通常少于更多。除非你有断路或短路，否则就不会有一个。每次反射都会变得越来越小。经过多次思考。来回弹跳的方式的大小可以忽略不计。忽略它，因为它太小了在那。我们所说的是稳定状态已经写好了。当我关闭开关时，瞬态周期开始，我的波开始了。当反射的大小变得可以忽略时，它就结束了。你以前见过这个。从技术上讲，你使用一个当我们在这里没有得到复数时，电路的时间常数的5倍的值。我们只是接受这种情况。

As tea tends to infinitythen the voltage at any point on the line is the superposition. That simply means that adding together of all of the waves that have passed that point on the line the voltage at the load, for example maybe one plus, V one minus, and so on, not going to read them all out

如茶趋向无穷那么线路上任意一点的电压都是叠加的。简单地说就是把所有通过这条线上的点的波加在一起。例如，负载处的电压也许是一加，V一减，等等，不打算把它们都读出来。

Over however much time, you look at thatwe can write that in terms of reflection coefficients and the initial voltageI think, is V one minus is simply V one plus multiplied by gamma L V two plus is V one minus multiplied by gamma L, multiplied by gamma S and so on.

不管过了多久，你看看那个。我们可以用反射系数和初始电压来表示。我认为，是V 1减是简单的V 1加乘以gamma lV二加是V减去1乘以伽玛L，乘以伽玛S如此等等

Nowagain, I don't eatIt's not difficult, but I don't expect you to be memorizing a derivation like thisAll the fact that we can use a binomial expandBasically, we can take an infinite number of these reflection proponentsWe can break them into 2 sets. Each of those sets looks like a binomial expansion We can write a final expression that represents the voltage of the load after an infinite number of reflections what real studies sayYou can buy the same expression.  We can substitute for V one plus, because we have a way of representing V one plus. That tells me what voltage I will see after an infinite amount of time at the lowAgain, you don't need to remember that equation. NotebookIs there an easier way for us to consider thisIf I'm asking that kind of question, it should be obvious that the answer is otherwise. I wouldn't be asking that kind of way

现在再说一次，我不吃这并不难，但我并不指望你能做到。记住这样的推导我们可以用二项式展开基本上，我们可以无数这样的反思支持者我们可以让他们进入。2套。这些集合中的每一个看起来都像一个二项展开式。我们可以写出表示负载电压的最终表达式在无数次反射之后真正的研究表明你可以买同样的表情。我们可以用V+来代替，因为我们有一种表示V+的方法。这告诉我我将看到什么电压在损失了无限长的时间后再说一次，你不需要记住这个等式。笔记本有没有更简单的方法让我们考虑这个问题？如果我问这种问题，很明显答案是相反的。我不会以那种方式问你

There's an easier way after infinite reflectionswhat is the voltage differenceVn minus vs After I have an infinite number of waves bouncing back and forward, adding togetherWhat is the difference in voltage between the airport, the line of the output of the lightWho thinks it's being a no takersRigsby, zero.  Won't take itAnd two ticketsWho thinks it's C and cl What happened? Let me ask what happened when we close the switch and V one looks propagated along the line and arrived at the lowWhat did I say was the voltage everywhere on the transmission lineIt was all equal to the same value V one plusThat means that after an infinite number of reflections, there is no voltage difference between the input of the line and the output of the line. The whole line has been charged to the same potentialThat should be some senseEven if you just think about it practiceyou have adc source and the wire and then load you don't consider a voltage drop on the wire unless it's lossy

有一个更简单的方法。经过无限的思考电压差是多少？VN减去与在我有了无限个波浪来回反弹，叠加在一起。机场之间的电压差是多少，线路的输出灯谁认为这是存在A, 没有接受者瑞斯比，零不会接受的还有两张票谁认为是C和CL？发生了什么？让我问问发生了什么。当我们关闭开关时，V看起来是沿着线传播的到达了低处我说的是输电线上到处都是电压。它都等于相同的值V+1这意味着在无限次数的反射之后，线路的输入和线路的输出之间没有电压差。整条线路都充电了。到相同的电势这应该有点道理。即使你只是想想，练习一下。您有ADC源还有电线然后加载你不考虑电线上的电压降，除非它是有损耗的。

If you consider the kvlthe voltage source must be divided between the impedance of the voltage source and the load impedanceIn other words, it's a simple potential dividerVl, after an infinite number of reflections, must be a source voltage divided between the source and beams and the loaded beams. That results will be exactly the same as long as no difference in the two expressionsThey have been derived from different directions, do not try to equate themThey are not equitable noteDon't trying to write one from the other. You cannotThey have come from two different ways of looking at the system It is so pure that happy with thatHopefully happy with thatVoltage bounce diagramsThe voltage balance diagram is a way of keeping track of what's going on the transmission line during a transient periodalong the X axis is distance along the transmission lineAlong the Y axis is time with T equals zerowe won't close enter the translation line and travels to the low

如果你考虑KVL电压源必须在电压源阻抗和负载阻抗之间进行划分换句话说，它是一个简单的分压器。在无限次数的反射之后，VL必须是在源和光束以及负载光束之间划分的源电压那个结果会完全一样。只要两种表达方式没有区别它们源自不同的方向，不要试图将它们等同起来。他们是不公平的注意不要试图从一个写到另一个。你不能他们从两个不同的角度来看待这个系统。它是如此纯洁对此很满意希望对此感到满意。电压反弹图电压平衡图是一种跟踪输电线路运行情况的方法。在过渡期间沿X轴是沿传输线的距离沿着Y轴是时间其中t等于零。我们将不会关闭输入转换线并移动到日志

It takes L divided by velocity time together T equal L divided by B. Expect you to knowAt that time, it is reflected a troubled part of the line as V one minus, which is gamma LV plus. That. So to get back to the source, two L divided by V so on and so forthNow that the useful thing about the voltage bounce diagramit's like when you use it to determine the voltage at any.along the lineat any particular time I want to know what is the voltage herea three L over four length along the line. Why I would want to know that I have no idea just just as I'm interested todayI want to know what is the voltage here after this amount of time I draw a line through the voltage outside around I act together the waves that have passed this point up until this timeIn this caseeven if I chose this time hereonly these four ways have passed this point.

它需要L除以速度在一起的时间T等于L除以B希望你知道。在那时，它是反映。这条线的麻烦部分是V 1负，也就是伽马LV正那个。那么为了回到源头，两个L除以V如此等等现在关于电压反弹图的有用的东西就像你用它的时候一样。以确定电压在任何.沿着这条线。在任何特定的时间我想知道电压是多少？在这里沿着这条线的三个L超过四个长度。为什么我想知道我不知道刚刚正如我所感兴趣的今天我想知道这里的电压是多少？在这段时间之后我通过周围的电压画了一条线我和经过这一点的波浪一起行动，直到这个时候。在这种情况下即使我选择这个时间在这里只有这四种方式通过了这一点。

But until this time, those are the only four that I should have together That's what we use a voltage from diagramI can plot the voltage at this. a as a function of timeAgain, by considering when and which voltages have passed that. as time moving forward when T equals zeroI believe enters C equals zero doesn't pass here until this timeThree L of 4 feet. Byebye In three L over four V, the voltage at that point on the line becomes V one plus I then have to wait for this way to travel to the lowreflect from the locals and travel back to this. This timethe voltage changes will be supposed to be one plus B, will find this,  and so onAnd wait again, another period of timeFor this way to travel back to the source, travel back to this. I get another addition into my mind

但在此之前，这是我唯一应该拥有的四个人这就是我们使用的图中的电压。我可以画出电压图。在这个。A作为时间的函数同样，通过考虑何时以及哪些电压已经通过。随着时间的推移当t等于零时我相信进入C等于零直到这个时候才经过这里3 L 4英尺拜拜在三个L除以四个V中，线上该点的电压变为V+1然后我不得不等待。对于这种方式向低处旅行从当地人那里反映出来，然后回到这里。这次假设电压变化为1+B，将找到这个，以此类推。再次等待，另一段时间以此道行归本源，行归于此。我脑子里又多了一样东西。

Over time, we will see that this voltage approaches the steady state voltage You would have to add together an infinite number of those to get into the setting stable. Byebye. Why is it? I believe this you can more or less ignore. We've talked about this in terms of voltage transients, because they're easier to deal with We could have derived very similar expressions in terms of currentWe never do because current requires that we remember an additional minus sign. The voltage just adds that is easier to deal with Current can be usedWe won't be using it. It's just that for your information there are some examples that I will go through next week for the lateAny does anybody want to ask questions about what we just discussed voltage and current transitions before I move on a little bit? But we have a qualitative this discussion about some of the restAnyone? No oneOkay, assuming you're all very happy with that I have here the simple system.

随着时间的推移，我们会看到这个电压接近稳态电压你必须把无数个这些加在一起。进入设置马厩拜拜为什么是我相信你可以或多或少地忽略这一点。我们已经从电压瞬变的角度讨论过这个问题，因为它们更容易处理。我们可以根据电流推导出非常相似的表达式我们从不这样做，因为电流要求我们记住一个额外的负号。电压只是增加了那更容易处理。可以使用电流我们不会用它的。这只是供你参考。有一些例子。我将在下周完成。为迟到的人在我继续之前，有没有人想问关于我们刚才讨论的电压和电流转换的问题？但我们有一个关于其余部分的定性讨论有人吗没有人好吧，假设你们对此都很满意我这里有一个简单的系统。

Another battery has a switch of the light a very long way awayI followed the switch, the light will lightI will do the switch, the light will not lightAssume that what is actually injected into the transmission line here to light the light is a voltage pulse. Let's just assume that what that diagram representsIt's not particularly important I put my square voltage pulse in the input to my long transmission line and then travels up the linelikes the light from what are the effects of distance on my post? WellI describe this kind of already. There are three effects here that you should be able to seeFirst of allthe polls took some time to arriveOf course, it took some time to arriveYeah, II don't switch on the lights.  It might look like when I hit the light switch, the light comes on immediately, but it does actually take some time for that to happen

另一块电池在很远的地方有一个电灯开关。我按着开关，灯就亮了。我会做开关，灯不会亮。假设实际上是什么注入到这里的传输线中以点亮该光的是电压脉冲。让我们假设那张图代表什么？这不是特别重要。我把我的方波电压脉冲输入到我的长传输线，然后沿着传输线向上传输。喜欢来自的光距离对我的帖子有什么影响？好吧我已经描述了这种。这里有三个效果，你应该可以看到。首先民意调查花了一段时间才到达。当然，过了一段时间才到达。是的，我不开灯。它可能看起来像是当我按下电灯开关时，灯立即亮起，但实际上这确实需要一些时间才能发生。

There is a delayWhat other effects can we see here The pulse is broadened, and there's some rippling on the Top That's called distortionThe shape of the pulse has been distortedAnd the dictionarythe post has been attenuatedThe average size of the pulses decrease Those are three effects I would expect to seeIf I have a long transmission line system on the polls doesn't matter what's at the end of the systemI put a sweat holes into the inputIt will take time to arrive at the output. It is possibleIt will broaden and ripple. And if the cable is lossythere will be attenuated and so onGenerally, in Januarythose are three thingsThe delay happens The delay happens anyway, but the delay is more than you might expected to read because of our distributed inductance and capacitance We might expect the wave to travel at the speed of light. It travels slightly slower than thatNot much slower, I should. Aisha Maybe half the speed of light that's still very fast

有延迟我们在这里还能看到什么其他效果？脉搏变宽了，上面有一些涟漪。这就是所谓的扭曲脉冲的形状被扭曲了。还有字典这个职位已经被削弱了。脉冲的平均大小减小这是我希望看到的三种效果。如果我有一个很长的传输线系统在民意调查中，系统的末端是什么并不重要。我在输入中放了一个汗孔要达到产量还需要时间。这是可能的它会变宽并泛起涟漪。和如果电缆有损耗会有衰减等等。一般来说，在一月份这是三件事。延迟发生了延迟无论如何都会发生，但由于我们的分布式电感和电容，延迟可能比您预期的要大。我们可以期望波以光速传播。它的速度比那稍微慢一点。慢不了多少，我应该艾莎也许是光速的一半，但仍然很快。

It's not very small mostly the capacitor that slows the way down. So it might take a little bit longer than you were expected. Byebye. The attenuation Let's say we were measuring the attenuation on the systemAnd suppose that my line is a hundred kilometers long. And after 1 kilometer, I measured myI mentioned the size of the signal, and it was.8 of its original value Then after another kilometer, I measured in size again, and there was another.8 of the previous volume and so on. So for every kilometerI go down by another factor of.8 that describes in itself what an actual system would do, and it describes an exponential decayNow, we already know from our derivation last week A single traveling along a transmission line will exponentially decay, governed by a parameter we call Alpha, the attenuation constantNow, in this case, we want to find Alpha by simply taking the natural log of both sidesThe unit of Alphainteresting unitUnit is numbers per some unit distance.

它不是很小。主要地电容器减慢了速度。所以这可能比你预期的时间要长一点。拜拜衰减假设我们正在测量系统上的衰减假设我的线路有一百公里长。1公里后，我测量了我的我提到了信号的大小，它是原始值的0.8。然后又过了一公里，我又量了一次尺寸，又是以前体积的0.8。所以每公里我又下降了0.8倍。这本身就描述了一个实际系统会做什么，它描述了指数衰减。现在，我们已经从我们的上周的推导沿着传输线传播的信号将呈指数衰减，这由我们称之为α的参数决定，即衰减常数。现在，在这种情况下，我们想通过简单地取两边的自然对数来找到α阿尔法的单位有趣的单位单位为每一些单位距离。

And this makes letters of kilometerMembers is not an official si unit, and you will only come across it in this field of studyI don't think you'll come across it in other fieldsOftenyou will see that attenuation quoted in DB per kilometer or DB per unit distance beforeYou can find that in the same way, by taking 20 log of that valuethere is a conversion between members and DV per kilometer. You can take a value in numbers or whatever, multiply it by 8.686 and get the value in DV,  whatever. That is the direct utraIt comes from taking 20 longa couple moreThat is where 8.666 not very importantJust for meAnd our final observation relates to distortion where distortion comes fromWhy does the shape change? Anybody willing to Hansardsome input.

这就是千米的字母成员不是一个正式的国际单位制单位，你只会在这个研究领域我不认为你会在其他领域遇到它。经常您将看到之前以dB/km或dB/单位距离为单位的衰减你可以用同样的方法找到它，取这个值的20个对数。每公里的成员和DV之间有一个转换。你可以用数字或其他任何东西来取一个值，乘以8.686并得到DV中的值，等等。那是直接的乌特拉它来自于长达20年的再来几个那就是8.666不是很重要只为我我们最后的观察与扭曲有关。失真从何而来为什么形状会改变？有人吗愿意议会议事录一些投入。

And why does the shape take? Why does it get broaderWhy does it spray? AnyoneYou'll be so happy to see the word Korea. On my slide. We're not going to do the fourier analysisBut what you should recognize is a rectangular pulse will be constructed from an infinite number of sinusoidal signalsNow, on a transmission line, on a real transmission linephase velocityits frequency dependent the slower frequencies will tend to travelNow, I'm gonna have to make a guess that partner, I believe, the slower frequencies travel slower, higher frequencies travel faster When they arrived at the outputBut when they arrive at the end of a long transmission lineDifferent frequency components are arriving at different timesYou no longer have them all adding together nicely into a rectangle, because faster components of a ride faster than the slower components that leads to a broadening of the post

为什么会有这样的形状？为什么它变得更广泛？它为什么会喷？有人吗你会很高兴看到韩国这个词。在我的幻灯片上。我们不打算做傅立叶分析。但你应该认识到的是一个矩形脉冲。将由无限数量的正弦信号构成。现在，在传输线上，在真正的传输线上相速度它的频率依赖性较慢的频率将倾向于旅行现在，我将不得不做一个猜测，我相信，较慢的频率传播较慢，较高的频率传播较快当他们到达时在输出端但当他们到达终点时一条长传输线的不同的频率分量在不同的时间到达你再也不能把它们很好地加在一起形成一个矩形，因为较快的部件比较慢的部件更快。这导致了职位的扩大。

You no longer have nice square edgesbecause some things are taking longer, some things are taking less time. You end up with this broadening phenomenon that is called distortionIn particulardispersion. So we have 2 types of distortionDispersion relates to the variable, speed or velocity with frequencySimilarly, attenuation on the line will likely be frequency dependence because different sinusoidal frequencies as part of our career analysis are being attenuated by different amounts. Again, when they act together, what you end up with is a rippling effect across the Top of the box This is typically posed due to the variation in attenuation the broadening is typically caused due to the time variation in different frequencies problems that has an impact on both thingsBut that also impacts directly. But the rippling is more an impact of very attenuationThis is just for information Don't get too excited. We're not going to analyze this. What's going onYou can create a dispersionless lineDo you kind of create a transmission line on which every frequency travels at the same velocity

你不再有漂亮的方形边缘。因为有些事情需要更长的时间，有些事情需要更短的时间。你最终会得到这种扩大的现象。那叫做失真尤其是分散。所以我们有两种类型的失真分散与频率有关的变量、速度或速率同样，线路上的衰减将可能是频率依赖性因为作为我们职业分析的一部分，不同的正弦频率被衰减了不同的量。再一次，当他们一起行动时，你最终得到的是盒子顶部的涟漪效应。这是典型的摆拍由于衰减的变化加宽通常是由于不同频率问题中的时间变化引起的这对两件事都有影响。但这也有直接影响。但涟漪的影响更多的是非常衰减这只是为了提供信息。别太激动了。我们不打算分析这个。这是怎么回事可以创建无色散线。你会创造一条传输线吗？每个频率都以相同的速度传播。

It was done byNow the guy's name escapes meAll of the every side he worked out how you can adapt the Model parameters of a

已经完成了由现在我想不起那家伙的名字了所有的每一面他健身了你如何适应A的模型参数
